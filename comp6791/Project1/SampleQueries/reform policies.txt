<TITLE>GLOBAL FARM REFORM TOP U.S. PRIORITY - SHULTZ</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dismantling agricultural subsidies
and implementing international farm policy reform will be the
top priorities of the United States at the upcoming Venice
Economic Summit, Secretary of State George Shultz told a group
of American farm leaders.
    "We want to see the American farmer put in a position in
which he can compete on a level playing field," Shultz told the
board of directors for the National Association of Wheat
Growers.
    The global agricultural situation is in the midst of the
most serious farm crisis in modern history, Shultz said, and
how the U.S. responds to the current problems will determine
whether the U.S. will continue its leadership role in world
agriculture.
    Government policies that subsidize production and exports
have created a "crisis of overproduction," he said. Shultz
particularly criticized European Community policies which he
said encourage domestic production by providing high government
supports to farmers and then exporting the surplus product with
the help of huge subsidies.
    The U.S. and its trading partners cannot afford to continue
current high levels of subsidies, he said. But the U.S. cannot
stop subsidies alone, Shultz said. "We have to agree to
dismantle these systems together," he said.
    The U.S., EC and Japan have the obligation to take the lead
in agricultural reform, he said. For that reason, U.S.
officials will push for farm reform at the Venice meeting and
have made it a top priority for GATT negotiations in Geneva.

<TITLE>BAKER SAYS U.S. MAKING PROGRESS REFORMING IADB</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MIAMI, March 23 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said
he was making progress negotiating reform of the Inter-American
Development Bank with other member nations.
    In a speech prepared for delivery to the annual meeting of
the IADB, Baker said, "We are making progress in negotiating
reforms."
    And he added that if succesful, Washington would be ready
to put up an additional nine billion dlrs to the seventh IADB
four-year capital replenishment, an increase of 75 pct.
    It was not immediately clear what the overall size of the
capital replenishment would be if the U.S. went ahead with such
a capital increase.
    But Baker's statement that he had made progress in
negotiating reforms came after a weekend meeting of the bank's
policy making board of governors at which the reform issue was
put off until next June because of deep differences between
Washington and Latin borrowing countries.
    Baker said the U.S. increase would account for 70 pct of
the bank's useable financial resources.
    Currently Washington is only allowed to vote 34.5 pct in
IADB board meetings considering loans to Latin American
countries.
    But the Latin borrowing nations control 54 pct of the vote
and frequently approve loans to which economic reform
conditions are not tied.
    Baker pointed out that Western nations which provide 95 pct
of the bank's financial resources represent just 46 pct of the
vote.
    Baker said the U.S seeks a greater say in bank decisions
for itself and other creditor countries.
    "In view of this imbalance we don't believe it is
unreasonable to ask for a change," Baker said. He said the
changes sought by the U.S. would require loan approval by a
greater majority of shares than a simple majority.
    But he stopped short of reaffirming the original U.S.
position that veto power should exist with a 35 pct vote.
    Enlarging on reforms Washington would like to see, Baker
said he wanted the IADB to play a much greater role in the U.S.
debt strategy for promoting inflation free economic growth,
open markets and a reduced government role in the economies of
debtor nations.
    Under reforms he said the U.S. wants the IADB to adopt a
major program of lending to specific economic sectors in debtor
countries on condition the countries carried out policy reforms
in those areas of their economies.
    Such reforms would include, among other things, more
concern for natural resource management.
    Baker said this lending should help debtors make a
transition to more open economies and freer markets.
    He also said the bank could double its current lending
volume from capital and triple its concessional loans to the
poorest nations.
    The Treasury Secretary also called for the IADB to improve
its analysis of the policies of debtor countries, strengthening
its process for assessing the specific needs of debtor nations.
He urged a wholesale reorganization of bank personnel. Baker
said, "We simply believe that more discretion and policy
influence should lie with the parties which contribute the
lion's share of resources."
    He pointed out that despite tight budget problems the
Reagan administration has asked Congress to finance the IADB
and other multilateral development banks.
    Pointing out that such funding was difficult today in the
best of circumstances, he said it would be impossible if
Congress did not have confidence in bank lending policies.

<TITLE>CHINA REFORMS TO TAKE DECADES, NO ALTERNATIVE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Mark O'Neill, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>China's economic reforms will take
decades to fulfill and will outlast the life of any leader
because they are the only way to save the country from poverty,
an economist in one of the country's top think tanks told
Reuters.
    But He Weiling, Washington representative of the China
Economic System Reform Institute, said China's economic reforms
definitely are not at risk from the nationwide drive since
January against "bourgeois liberalism," a phrase meaning Western
political ideas.
    He said "bourgeois liberalism" is not affecting departments
dealing with economics.
    His is one of a small number of key institutes, set up in
the early 1980s, which formulate economic reform policies and
advise the top leadership on them.
    Discussing subjects raised in the budget speech last week,
which put the 1986 and 1987 deficits at more than 15 billion
yuan because of excessive consumer demand and capital
construction plus falling efficiency in state firms, He said
reform of state firms and the financial system is the key goal
for 1987.
    "The most difficult thing is to strike the balance between
making them independent units and the need for central control,"
He said.
    "We are exploring ways of doing this, through joint stock
ownership, leasing, factory management responsibility systems
or in other ways," he added.
    One of the most serious problems facing China's leaders is
how to curb excess investment in capital construction,
especially in projects outside the state plan.
    He said this problem is chronic in all socialist economies.
    This is because firms are judged on output, not
profitability or efficiency.
    "Firms use every excuse to get money and materials. They say
they want money to build offices but in fact use it to build
apartments, which is unauthorised," He said.
    "Also, it is not good to report profits, which would mean
higher tax payments. It is better to report a loss," he added.
    He said China's state firms are continuing a 5,000-year-old
tradition when they under-report their assets in order to
reduce claims on them by higher authority.
    He said China will have to improve auditing, economic
regulations and the tax system, which he described as "chaotic,"
especially at the lower levels, in order to deal with
under-reporting.
    "Another important step is to further develop the money
markets to give firms an opportunity to invest. They need
channels for this which they do not have now. Without this,
there will be no genuine supply and demand for money," he said.
    As a reform to encourage efficiency, China now supplies
state firms with loans instead of grants as in the past.
    But He said the reforms have not resulted in much real
change because the loans carry low-interest. "So some efficient
firms have not been able to get money from banks."
    Price reform has been one of the most sensitive aspects of
the reform programme. Widespread discontent over price rises
forced the government to promise in January that there will be
no major increases in 1987.
    He said the price of steel, timber and cement and other
industrial raw materials only will "rise gradually" this year.
    Large-scale price adjustments would have an adverse
psychological impact and create social discontent.
    "We must preserve unity and popular support," he said, but
"sometimes, the common people must make a sacrifice, like those
of Germany and Japan after 1945."
    He said restrictions on a wide range of prices, including
most farm and light industrial products, have been lifted and
many intermediate pricing schemes scrapped over the last eight
years.
    "It will take at least 15 to 20 years to complete an
overhaul of the price system. We must move carefully. We have
no model to work from and have only ourselves to rely on," He
said.
    He said the greatest fear expressed by foreigners is that
reform and open-door policies will not survive the death of
certain elderly leaders.
    He did not name top leader Deng Xiaoping, 82, the chief
architect of both policies since 1979.
    "These fears are unfounded. The two policies have already
become the basic national policy of China. The reforms are
irreversible. China is one of the poorest 25 countries in the
world. Without the reforms, how are we to escape from this
poverty?"

<TITLE>U.S. "ACTION PROGRAM" FOR SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Reagan administration,
responding to last year's United Nations special session on
Africa, today outlined a U.S. "action program" for sub-Saharan
Africa focusing heavily on economic reform and self-help.
    A White House statement announced establishment of "a
long-term U.S. goal for all U.S. economic programs and policies
in sub-Saharan Africa: to end hunger in the region through
economic growth, policy reform and private sector development."
    The statement said the "program of action" was recommended by
a White House task force set up last September.
    In a series of recommendations, the task force called for
new efforts to address Africa's heavy debt burden and said U.S.
food aid should stress production incentives to reinforce
African nations' economic reform and productivity.
    It also said better African access to world markets should
be promoted to reward good performance and enable African
nations to earn their way toward economic growth.
    The U.S. private sector should be mobilized to provide
"private, voluntary and corporate involvement of a humanitarian
    It said donor countries "should negotiate, through the
existing International Monetary Fund/World Bank coordination
process, framework agreements with each sub-Saharan African
country to establish long-term structural adjustment and reform
programs."
    The task force called for a separate budget account for
U.S. bilateral aid "in order to focus better on rewarding
economic performance and increasing the flexibility of U.S.
assistance programs for incentive economic reforms and private
sector development."

<TITLE>WORLD BANK EXTENDS 241 MLN DLRS IN AFRICAN LOANS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>The World Bank said it has extended
loans totalling 241 mln dlrs to Niger and Zaire to help support
economic reforms through structural adjustment programs.
    The loans have been made through the International
Development Association (IDA), the bank's concessionary lending
arm, and the African Facility, a three-year IDA-administered
fund that supports economic policy reforms in sub-Saharan
Africa, the bank said.
    Zaire's structural adjustment program, supported by a 67
mln dlr IDA loan and a 94 mln dlr African Facility loan, hopes
to lay the basis for sustained economic growth, the bank said.
    Included in the program's goals are strengthening private
sector incentives, aiding macroeconomic management, and
unspecified changes in transportion and agricultural policies,
the bank said.
    Niger's structural adjustment program, supported by a 60
mln dlr IDA loan and a 20 mln dlr African Facility loan, hopes
to aid public spending controls, support pricing reforms, and
encourage private sector competition, the bank said.

<TITLE>CONSENSUS BUILDS FOR WORLD AGRICULTURAL REFORM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Top U.S. and European farm trade and
government representatives called for a sweeping reform of
world agriculture to redress a critical demand and supply
imbalance.
    Speakers at a conference on world agricultural markets here
demonstrated a growing U.S.-European consensus on the need for
an urgent and collective overhaul of world farm trade and
production.
    "It is vital that we work together to bring more freedom and
harmony into the world agricultural trade...(if not) the
disruptions in markets may grow even more severe, the walls of
protection climb higher and the level of possible retaliation
become more harmful," U.S. Department of Agriculture Deputy
Administrator William Bailey said.
    Bailey said his attendance at the two-day meeting, which
ends tomorrow, demonstrated the U.S. recognises the need to
adjust its policies to the changing market environment.
    The need for urgent reforms is justified by the "imbalance
and tensions of the world economy," the secretary general of the
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
Jean-Claude Paye said.
    And the forum for such a reform is the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, he noted.
    Paye stressed the need for a progressive and joint
reduction of agricultural subsidies as well as social measures
to help farmers in unprofitable areas.
    Another possible solution would be to stop supporting farm
prices, allowing them to be fixed by supply and demand, and
instead help farmers through income support and adjustment
aids, proposed James Howard, Executive Vice-president of
Cargill (USA), one of the world's largest cereal houses.
    Franz-Josef Feiter, agricultural adviser to West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, agreed the European Community must take
greater heed of market constraints in fixing farm prices.
    However, "differentiated policy treatment is required" to
take account of large disparities in the situation around the
EC, he said.
    "Agriculture is an efficient sector of the European economy
and will remain so if the right policy is pursued within the
Community," he said.

<TITLE>CHINA CURTAILS KEY REFORM GOAL OF REALISTIC PRICES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Mark O'Neill, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Fear of social instability and inflation
has forced China to curtail a major economic reform --
overhauling a pricing system in which prices bear no relation
to production costs.
    Despite pledges last year that price changes were needed to
get the economy on the right track, Peking has repeatedly said
no major change will happen this year. The backtracking has
occurred during a conservative backlash following the
resignation in January of reformist Communist Party leader Hu
Yaobang, western diplomats and Chinese sources say.
    "Price changes in the last two years have aroused great
public discontent, especially in the cities," one western
diplomat said.
    "Chinese were used to stable prices for 30 years from 1949
when the communists took over. On a recent visit to two major
cities, the refrain from all the officials was the need to
preserve social stability."
    A Chinese journalist said the reformers under-estimated the
potential public resistance to price increases.
    "A major review of all economic reforms is under way, the
biggest since the reforms began in 1979, because many things
are not going well -- a large budget deficit, too rapid price
increases and no major improvement in productivity of state
firms," the Chinese journalist said.
    This view was reflected by the official People's Daily in a
major article this week. The daily said price increases had
been taking place too quickly in recent years.
    "In future, price changes should be only in small steps," it
said, adding that wage increases and lax monetary policies had
resulted in too much money chasing too few goods.
    The Chinese journalist said the review was in part due to
political factors.
    "Economics and politics are inseparable in China. But the
western media are wrong to classify the leadership into
reformers and conservatives. All the leaders agree on the main
direction -- economic reform and the open-door," he said.
    "But there are differences of opinion on the pace of reform
and on specific policies. No one is advocating a return to how
things were before 1979."
    Those who say prices should reflect production costs
believe the issue is vital to China's economy.
    Sugar is an example. An official newspaper said earlier
this year that over 40 pct of the country's sugar mills were
losing money, or had closed because the price of sugar had not
changed for 20 years, while the production costs have risen
sharply over the same period.
    The western diplomat said Chinese leaders did not fear a
backlash against rising prices would result in rioting in the
streets, which they had the means to control.
    "The bottom line is how such protests would be used by those
in the power struggle (inside the Communist Party)," he said.
    Said a foreign lawyer, referring to the crisis sparked by
student demonstrations which led to Hu's replacement, "The
leadership here is a self-perpetuating oligarchy. There is no
way that it is going to give up power."
    The Chinese journalist added that China appears to have
reached a crossroads.
    "There is no clear proposal as to what to do next," he said.
"Premier Zhao (Ziyang) has instructed his think-tanks to come up
with how to continue the reforms in 1988."
    But for the time being at least, the path leading to price
reforms is out of favour.

<TITLE>CHINA DELAYS REFORM BECAUSE OF POLITICS, ECONOMICS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Mark O'Neill, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>China had postponed wide-ranging plans to
reform its economy because of financial difficulties and
pressure from powerful conservatives within the ruling
Communist Party, western diplomats said.
    But they said that although the conservatives were critical
of aspects of the current open-door policy they had no
alternative economic program. That meant that the strategy
begun by top leader Deng Xiaoping in 1978 was likely to go on,
but at a slower pace, they said.
    Deng has led China's overhaul of the Stalinist economy
built during the rule of Chairman Mao. Since Mao died in 1976
living standards have risen sharply and China has become a net
exporter of grain for the first time.
    A western diplomat said China's leaders had been
sufficiently encouraged by their success last year to order the
drawing up of plans for more reforms for 1987. These included
changes to the country's price system.
    But he said the biggest reforms had been shelved since
economic problems appeared in late 1986 and the resignation of
Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang in January.
    The diplomat said the most ambitious reforms would not be
on the agenda for a major party meeting later this year.
    The main economic reform proceeding in 1987 is a system
under which factories sign contracts with the government. They
can keep any profit over and above the contract amount.
    "This is a modest reform, a repeat of what China did in the
early 1980s," the diplomat said.
    "It is regarded as second best by the reformers who drew up
the more ambitious plans. But these are impractical in the
current political and economic climate," he said.
    A Chinese source said that a month ago Premier Zhao Ziyang
decided the media was giving too much coverage to the drive
against bourgeois liberalism and not enough to explaining the
proposed reforms. Some of these reforms, like price increases,
were very unpopular.
    Zhao ordered the media to give more coverage to the reforms
and why they were necessary, the source said.
    One of China's top economists wrote in the People's Daily
last week, "Failure to answer people's questions about the new
prices has caused great anxiety."
    In March, China announced budget deficits for 1986 and
1987. It has had two years of trade deficits, and capital
spending and wages are rising fast.
    On the political front, the conservatives in the Party have
been on the offensive since January when Hu resigned. He
allegedly failed to fight the growth of western democratic
ideas, which the Party has called bourgeois liberalism.
    A nationwide drive against bourgeois liberalism has been
under way since January in the Party and the media. The latter
has given wide coverage to those in the leadership who have
warned against the errors of all-out westernisation.
    The economist said, "Although reform in any country
inevitably causes anxiety and is often risky, it has been
proved that, where reform is more daring, commodities are more
abundant and people's living standards higher."
    "But in the countries that are more rigid, the market is
stagnant, goods are in short supply and rationing is common," he
said.
    The diplomat said the reformers wanted to complete their
unfinished overhaul of China's pricing system.
    The diplomat said the reformers wanted to make factories
independent of the government which would use taxes, credit
supply and other indirect means to regulate them instead of
administrative diktat as in the past.
    "But to enact such far-reaching measures they need a stable
economy, contented workers and surpluses, to give them
manoeuvring room. These conditions do not exist now," he said.
    Another diplomat said that conservatives within the
leadership, though critical of some results of the reforms, had
no alternative economic strategy.
    "The last eight years of opening to the outside world has
shown everyone how poor China is and how it has fallen behind
other countries," the diplomat said.
    "Everyone is agreed on the objective that China become a
major world power by the early 21st century," he said.
    "For this, it needs a strong and modernised economy. Where
there is disagreement is over the pace of the reforms and the
details of some of them."
    The Chinese source said the debate over the pace and extent
of reforms was still going on.

<TITLE>AUSTRALIAN MINISTER SEES HOPE FOR FARM REFORM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Australia's Minister for Trade
Negotiations is optimistic that progress is possible on
reducing the large subsidies which the European Community and
United States grant their farmers.
    Michael Duffy said a European Commission scheme to reform
the EC Common Agricultural Policy and U.S. Plans to eliminate
farm subsidies over 10 years are steps in the right direction.
    "I am hopefully optimistic... There is goodwill in
agricultural reform being shown by the USA, the EC and the
Cairns Group," he told reporters.
    Duffy said the Cairns Group of 14 agricultural and
commodity producers is on the verge of agreeing a common
position for forthcoming General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT) talks on farm subsidies.
    The group, which includes Australia and Malaysia, advocates
free farm trade and says U.S., European and Japanese subsidies
are stopping it competing in its traditional markets.
    Duffy is on a two-day visit to Malaysia after talks in
North and South America, the EC and Thailand, and leaves for
Indonesia on Wednesday.

<TITLE>CHERNOBYL TO CAUSE PROBLEMS FOR SOVIET ELECTRICITY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Chernobyl nuclear plant disaster
has left Soviet plans to extend nuclear power stations
unchanged, but will in the long run cause major problems for
the electricity industry, a Western expert said.
    West German economics researcher Jochen Bethkenhagen, in a
report presented to a NATO economics seminar, said increased
targets for Soviet nuclear energy output showed the April,
1986, disaster had not caused any change in Moscow's energy
policy.
    But the accident was expected to prompt design changes in
future Soviet power stations to "exclude manipulations of safety
equipment" of the sort that occurred at Chernobyl, he said.
    This will presumably result in substantial delays in the
completion of reactor blocks and in stricter quality controls
during the construction of nuclear power stations, he said.
    Bethkenhagen said the Chernobyl accident was also likely to
have frustrated for a long time Soviet hopes of exports of
nuclear power stations to countries outside the Comecon bloc.
    "It is also doubtful that the talks with China, Syria, Libya
and Iraq with regard to Soviet deliveries in the next few years
will have positive results," he said.
    The meeting heard views of academics and Kremlin-watchers
on the impact of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev on energy
policy.
    Several participants today argued that Gorbachev was
unlikely to extend his internal economic policies to the energy
sector, at least for now.
    Bethkenhagen said high energy growth targets set by the
Soviet Union up to the end of the decade showed Moscow intended
to stick to a rigid supply-, rather than demand-oriented
policy.
    Norwegian academics Arild Moe and Helge Ole Bergesen said
that the Soviet fuel industries represented such a pillar of
the economy that immediate reform was tricky. "Any 'experiment'
on a large scale cannot be allowed, because the negative
consequences if a reform backfires will be too great," they
said.

<TITLE>SRI LANKA AND IMF AGREE ON ECONOMIC REFORMS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Marilyn Odchimar, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    COLOMBO, April 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sri Lanka and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) have reached agreement on the broad outline
of economic reforms, but tough negotiations are likely before
the IMF approves up to 240 mln dlrs in loans, a senior finance
ministry official told Reuters.
    He said the government and IMF this week agreed on a
package to reduce the balance of payments deficit, improve
management of public enterprises, reform tariffs, develop
non-traditional exports and privatise public firms.
    An IMF-World Bank team will visit Colombo next month to
start negotiations on details of a three-year economic reform
programme. "There is a broad agreement on the content of the
policy package for a structural reform," the official said. "But
in areas where the reform would take place, there would be
tough neotiations on how much you do and in what order should
it take place," he added.
    Sri Lanka is seeking a total of about 240 mln dlrs in
structural adjustment loans to support the balance of payments
and in a compensatory financing facility to offset losses in
commodity exports.
    Sri Lanka needs the IMF and World Bank approval of the two
facilities to clear the way for negotiations on requests for
aid and loans from donor countries.
    These include an expected pledge of 550 mln dlrs from from
12 industrialised countries and about 240 mln dlrs in loans
from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
    Finance Minister Ronnie De Mel said in an interview
published today by the Daily News that there was likelihood of
Sri Lanka obtaining all of that aid despite intense lobbying by
pro-Tamil and human rights groups abroad.
    He said that although friendly countries were still
prepared to assist Sri Lanka with concessional aid, Colombo
would have to surmount many problems in detailed negotiations
due in May, June and August before these loans are finalised.
    "In these matters, there's many a slip between the cup and
the lip as other governments have learned to their cost," De Mel
said.

<TITLE>CHIRAC ATTACKS EC COMMISSION BUDGET PROPOSALS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Prime Minister Jacques Chirac has attacked
budget proposals made by the European Community's executive
Commission, saying they ignore efforts to cut spending, and
added that divisions over the issue would be hard to resolve at
this week's EC summit.
    The Commission has proposed radical changes in the way the
member countries contribute to the budget, suggesting payments
should be linked to economic output instead of tax revenue.
    But the richer northern nations such as Britain, West
Germany and France are insisting on stricter spending controls
before agreeing to any reform.
    "The proposals of the Commission, at the level they are
being made, are not compatible with the efforts which each of
our nations is making to reduce spending ... Therefore there is
a big problem," Chirac said in a radio interview.
    EC leaders would also try to resolve a dispute on reforms
of agricultural spending, largely to blame for an expected 5.7
billion dlr shortfall in the EC budget this year.
    Chirac said that West Germany, under pressure from its
powerful farm lobby, was alone in opposing reforms to the
common agricultural policy, while France shared a common
position on the issue with the 10 other EC states.

<TITLE>TAKESHITA FACES TOUGH ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT JOB</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Tsukasa Maekawa</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Former Finance Minister Noboru Takeshita,
chosen on Monday to be Japan's next prime minister, will face a
tough test in managing Japan's economy from the very start of
his two-year term, economists and businessmen said.
    Takeshita told a news conference on Tuesday that he would
do his best to continue the domestic reforms and external
policies of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.
    However, leading Japanese businessmen called on Takeshita
to outdo Nakasone by showing stronger leadership.
    "Takeshita should not merely follow the Nakasone policies
but should cope with mounting economic issues with a new vision
and policies," Takashi Ishihara, chairman of the Japan Committee
for Economic Development, said in a statement.
    Economists generally agreed that there will be no major
changes in Japan's economic policies under a new leader.
    However, expectations are high among major industries for
new initiatives by Takeshita for immediate and effective
measures to solve economic problems such as trade friction with
the U.S., Administrative and tax reforms, and soaring land
prices.
    Eishiro Saito, chairman of the Federation of Economic
Organisations (Keidanren), urged Takeshita to succeed in
unifying the ruling Liberal Democratic Party as soon as
possible to tackle difficult tasks.
    Regarding foreign economic polices, Yoshitoki Chino,
chairman of the Japan Securities Dealers Association, said
Takeshita should come up with economic measures well before
economic issues develop into problems.
    Behind those calls on Takeshita for prompt action are
doubts about his capability in handling international issues
due to his lack of experience in diplomacy, economists said.
     Economists said foreign countries should be patient with
Takeshita, who is widely known as an ultra-cautious politician.
    Takeshita has repeatedly said, "There should be consensus
before taking action."
    Takeshita has so far failed to unveil specific measures to
reduce Japan's huge trade surplus, economists said.
    He has said Japan will continue to stimulate the economy
and to open the market wider to foreign products.

<TITLE>WORLD BANK CAN AID PHILIPPINES' LAND DEVELOPMENT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Chaitanya Kalbag, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The World Bank's policies prevent it from
lending money for the transfer of land from landowners to the
landless, but it can help finance development of the
Philippines' proposed land reform program, a bank official
said.
    "The World Bank by its established policies cannot use its
resources to finance the transfer of assets from one group to
another. Our mandate is to finance investment-related
activities," Rolando Arrivillaga, the bank's resident
representative in the Philippines, told Reuters in an
interview.
    Arrivillaga said he wanted to clarify part of a report by a
World Bank mission that came in March to review the land reform
program and which said the bank would not be able to finance
compensation payments for the transfer of land.
    He said the Philippine government had never asked the bank
to finance land transfers, and the bank's position should not
be taken to mean that it ruled out any lending for the program.
    "Clearly in the case of land reform the question of land
transfer by definition is transferring assets from the landed
to the landless," Arrivillaga said. "However, the bank as an
institution can finance the development aspects of the program."
    "We will deal with the part of the program that deals with
how to put the land to effective use once it has been
transferred and how to make the on-farm investments that are
needed to attain the goal of improving the income level of the
beneficiaries," Arrivillaga said.
    "I wouldn't be surprised if other multilateral institutions
are faced with similar constraints," he said.
    President Corazon Aquino's spokesman said last week that
she was committed to launching the program, which limits land
holdings to seven hectares, by using her sweeping powers of
rule by decree before a new Congress convenes in July.
    Presidential spokesman Teodoro Benigno said the land reform
program, estimated to cost about 44 billion pesos, would be
implemented in four phases and benefit 2.64 mln farmers.
    Benigno said the first two phases would complete the
transfer of rice and corn lands and abandoned farmland as well
as the transfer of land sequestered, expropriated or foreclosed
by the government and would cover 1.15 mln hectares.
    But Aquino would not decree the redistribution of large
sugar, banana and coconut plantations, leaving it to the
Congress to work out the details, Benigno said.
    Arrivillaga said bilateral aid donors, who form part of a
consultative group led by the World Bank, might be prepared to
finance the land transfers.
    "I don't think there are fast and easy rules as to how
international sources of finance would behave in a situation
like this, because land reform by its very nature requires rich
financing to be able to carry out the reform in a way equitable
to both the landowner and the beneficiary," he said.
    Arrivillaga said the first priority for the government
would be to tap domestic sources of financing for the land
transfer, but external assistance could be brought in if there
were gaps.
    "In such a fundamental reform the test of the willingness of
the government is how it confronts the domestic resource
requirement," Arrivillaga said. "Multilateral agencies by their
very nature are lenders of last resort. It means they have to
be convinced that the government prioritises the program."
    He said the World Bank had financed developmental costs
under an earlier land reform program launched by former
President Ferdinand Marcos in 1972, and such aid had been
channelled through the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP).
    The LBP is the main implementing agency under Aquino's
program.
    "If asked to do so again and the program is designed to
improve the standard of living of the poor then we would
certainly be prepared to consider (lending)," Arrivillaga said.
    He said the tendency in such programs was to exaggerate the
costs by presenting ten-year perspectives in a one-year
context.
    Arrivillaga said the government could solve most of its
financing problems by devising effective instruments to
compensate landowners.
    Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin has said landowners are
likely to be paid 10 pct in cash and the rest in 10-year bonds
with 10 pct of their face value redeemable each year.
    Arrivillaga said any instruments used to compensate
landowners had to be freely tradable at near face value and
added: "The challenge is to devise a system of deferred payments
that is as good as cash."
    He said the international financing community was watching
the Philippine experiment with great interest.
    "They are going to be an interesting model for many other
countries because they opened a dialogue on the reforms to
every sector of the population and even international
institutions," he said. "I think they'll be on a very solid base
when they make the decision to launch the reforms."

<TITLE>IMF, WORLD BANK CRITICAL OF AGRICULTURE PROTECTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 10 - </DATELINE><BODY>A committee of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank said protectionist
agricultural policies of industrial countries were a major
cause of depressed global commodity prices.
    The joint Development Committee, in a communique released
following day-long discussions, said an improved environment
for commodities was extremely important to the long-term
viability of developing countries.
    The committee also criticised the slow-down in lending to
debtor nations.
    Poorer countries, which rely primarily on raw commodity
sales to industrial nations to pay their debts, have been
highly critical of protectionist agricultural policies in the
United States, Western Europe and Japan.
    "Ministers identified protectionist agricultural policies as
a major cause of distortions including depressed commodity
prices on world markets, of surplus production and of budgetary
drain," the communique said.
    The communique, delayed because of disputes over specific
language, was the final statement by the IMF and the bank after
week-long semi-annual meetings of the two lending agencies.
    Earlier, the IMF's powerful Interim Committee added its
voice to growing criticism of delays by commercial banks on
critically needed loan packages for debt-laden developing
countries.
    The committee said it welcomed the exploration of new
procedures and financing techniques that will help mobilise new
financial support for indebted countries.
    On Thursday, U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker, in a
statement to the policy-making committee, said commercial bank
lending to debtor nations last year was disappointing and more
flexibility in loan programs was needed.
    "Doubts about financing can clearly undermine the resolve to
carry out needed reforms," Baker said.
    The Development Committee also joined in the criticism,
noting that there had been a declining flow of capital to the
developing countries that "has been particularly significant in
the case of flows from commercial banks."
    A number of bank negotiations are bogged down over details
including financial packages for Mexico, Nigeria and Argentina.
    The banks, acknowledging it has been difficult to complete
deals, say part of the blame goes to the developing countries
for not making sufficient reform to make them good credit
risks.

<TITLE>FERC ISSUES TAKE-OR-PAY GAS POLICY PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) issued a proposed policy statement for the 
recovery of take-or-pay costs imposed by existing natural gas
contracts between producers and pipelines.
    It put out the statement, by 5-0 vote, for a 30-day comment
period. It also put out an alternative policy statement by
Commissioner Charles Stalon.
    FERC said in a press release that "the proposed policy
statement estblishes an exception to the commission's general
policy that take-or-pay buy-out and buy-down costs must be
recovered through pipeline' commodity sales rates."
    FERC added that "specifically, in cases where pipelines
assume an equitable share of buy-out or buy-down costs, the
commission proposes to permit the pipelines to recover the
remaining costs through their demand rates."
    It said it wanted guidelines for buying out and reforming
existing contracts to help spread the impact of these
take-or-pay costs in a responsible, fair and equitable way.
    Commission chairwoman Martha Hesse said "this proposal
represents the commission's sincere attempt to help the
industry through this difficult period of transition to a more
competitive market."
    Hesse said "it is my hope that our proposed policy will
encourage and guide the timely resolution of take-or-pay
contractual disputes that have impeded the industry's
transition to a more competitive environment.  It is vital to
the industry that we get this problem behind us."

    Their immediate aim is to drain the wine and olive oil
"lakes" and level the "grain mountain" that have brought the
Community so much unwelcome publicity.
    Earlier this week, ministers finally agreed after 36 hours
of negotiations the fine details of an outline accord to cut
milk output by 9.5 pct over two years and reduce butter stocks,
now at a record 1.2 mln tonnes.
    Officials said new rules, which place strict limits on
farmers' rights to benefit from high subsidised prices, could
be expected to reduce sales into intervention to a trickle and
pave the way for reform in other surplus sectors.
    The deal was reached despite determined attempts at
backsliding by some states as the implications of the original
outline accord reached last December began to sink in.
    "Despite coming under tremendous pressure, the ministers
never wavered from the main features of the deal," one senior
official said, adding the result augured well for talks later
this month on other reforms.
    The Commission is leading the fight against food surpluses
and has now proposed the most severe annual price review, at
which ministers fix farm support prices, in the EC's history.
    Most prices would be cut or frozen, new quality standards
enforced, and most farmers' rights to sell to intervention
curtailed. Officials say the measures could lead to effective
price cuts for some low quality cereals of eight to 11 pct.
    EC Commissioner Frans Andriessen is currently working on
proposals to provide direct income aids to farmers to cushion
them from the worst effects of a restrictive price policy and
encourage ministers to swallow the reform pill.

<TITLE>CHINA PUTS BRAKE ON KEY REFORM GOAL</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Mark O'Neill</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Fear of social instability and inflation
has forced China to put the brakes on one of its most important
economic reforms -- overhauling a pricing system which often
bears no relation to production costs.
    The price clampdown has occurred during a conservative
backlash following the resignation in January of reformist
Communist Party leader Hu Yaobang, Western diplomats and
Chinese sources say.
    "In recent years, prices have not only been rising, but the
rate of increase is getting faster and faster," the People's
Daily said in a major article this week. "In future, price
changes should be only in small steps."
    Despite pledges last year that price changes were essential
to get the economy on the right track, the government has
repeatedly said no major change will happen this year.
    "Price changes in the last two years have aroused great
public discontent, especially in the cities," a Western diplomat
said.
    "Chinese were used to stable prices for 30 years from 1949
when the Communists took over. On a recent visit to two major
cities, the refrain from all the officials was the need to
preserve social stability," he said.
    A Chinese journalist said the reformers had underestimated
the extent to which the public would tolerate price changes.
    "A major review of all economic reforms is under way, the
biggest since the reforms began in 1979, because many things
are not going well -- a large budget deficit, too rapid price
increases and no major improvement in productivity of state
firms," he said.
    The reformers think it vital to change a system under which
prices often bear no relation to production costs.
    Sugar is an example. An official newspaper said earlier
this year that more than 40 pct of China's sugar mills were
losing money or had closed because producing sugar was so
unprofitable.
    This was because the selling price of sugar has not changed
for 20 years, while the mills' production costs have risen
sharply over the period.
    The economic masterplan for the 1986-90 period, published
in April last year, said China would "work steadily to establish
a pricing system which better reflects value and the relation
between supply and demand."
    The People's Daily said that in recent years wage increases
had been too high and too much currency printed, resulting in
too much money chasing too few goods and causing price hikes
and inflation.
    The review of the reforms coincides with a national
campaign against "bourgeois liberalism," meaning Western
political ideas blamed for causing student protests last
December.
    The journalist said the review was in part due to political
factors.
    "Economics and politics are inseparable in China. But the
Western media is wrong to classify the leadership into
reformers and conservatives. All the leaders agree on the main
direction -- economic reform and the open-door," he said.
    "But there are differences of opinion on the pace of reform
and on specific policies. No one is advocating a return to how
things were before 1979."
    The diplomat said what China feared as a backlash against
price rises was not so much rioting in the streets, which he
said it had the means to control. "The bottom line is how such
protests would be used by those in the power struggle."
    A foreign lawyer said he believed the cause of the crisis
earlier this year was that the Communist Party leadership had
feared, due to the student demonstrations, that it was losing
control.
    "The leadership here is a self-perpetuating oligarchy. There
is no way that it is going to give up power," he said.

<TITLE>TOP U.S. OFFICIAL SEES DELAY IN BANK REFORM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>A top Treasury official said he does
not expect any comprehensive Congressional reform of the U.S.
banking industry until after the 1988 presidential election due
to political pressures and, to a lesser extent, the insider
trading scandal on Wall Street.
    George Gould, Under Secretary of the Treasury, told a Wall
Street Planning Group luncheon, "legislation is not going to
happen before the election ... (people) do not like to vote on
controversial issues in election years."
    "It may take a while in the next administration ... to get
something done," he added.
    Calls for a major overhaul of the U.S. banking industry,
which would probably feature wider investment banking powers
for commercial banks, has met strong opposition from private
interest groups, such as the Securities Industry Association.
    "These discussions have nothing to do with merit ... these
groups are trying to cloak self-interest in public policy
terms," Gould said. "It is easier to stop something than it is
to get it going."
    He also described current concern about insider trading as
"a major impediment to further progress ... it is not a helpful
backdrop to accomplish financial reform."
    Similarly, Gould said lobbying by such groups as the U.S.
League of Savings Institutions would probably mean that the
Reagan Administration's proposal for the recapitalization of
the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp would be watered
down.
    Gould foresaw a five billion dlr injection over two years,
compared with the original request for 15 billion dlrs over
three years.
    Gould ruled out any new government initiative on banking
reform but said that some broad guidelines to address these
issues would be made public over the next few months.

<TITLE>POLISH TRADE OFFICIAL CALLS FOR FREER MARKET</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Irena Czekierska</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WARSAW, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Deputy Foreign Trade Minister Janusz
Kaczurba told Reuters that Poland would have to diverge from
traditional Communist bloc centrally-planned economic policies
if it wanted to bring about economic renewal and compete in
world markets.
    Stressing his commitment to a series of reforms recently
introduced to streamline the economy and boost export-oriented
industry, he also called for an expansion in the role of the
private sector.
    Asked whether the policies the government was advocating
did not represent a departure from the strictly controlled
economic model within the Soviet bloc, he said in an interview
with Reuters "I don't see any alternative but to try to proceed
along the lines of economic reasoning."
    He referred specifically to bankruptcies, which he said
would be "the logical outcome of a more stringent economic
policy," once the state stopped propping up enterprises to
guarantee jobs, regardless of how inefficient they were.
    He added, "We should follow the policy of creating a system
whereby managers will be really responsible for the overall
economic effect of enterprises. This can be done in one way
only, through the reduction of subsidies."
    But he also noted the need to curtail bureaucracy of branch
ministries, allow domestic prices to reflect the world market,
make foreign exchange rates more realistic, provide incentives
to export-oriented industry and encourage private business.
    Kaczurba was talking to Reuters about the effect on the
economy of U.S. Sanctions imposed in 1982 in response to the
suppression of the Solidarity trade union under martial law.
    He acknowledged that Poland's economic decline would add to
its problems in trying to regain markets and support from
Western creditors even after Washington lifted remaining
restrictions and restored Most Favoured Nation trading status
last month.
     Western officials say Polish goods have to be more
competitive and of better quality in the face of trade wars and
protectionism amongst U.S., Japanese and European competitors.
    Reaffirming the government's view that the key to solving
some of those problems and meeting payments on a 33.5 billion
dlr foreign debt lay in increasing hard currency exports,
Kaczura said private enterprise could play a greater role.
    "I think we could have some 20,000 small private enterprises
active in export-oriented business if such operators are
successfully convinced that the policy towards the (private)
sector is stabilised," he said.
    Poland already has a more developed private sector than
most other East European countries.
    Among economic reforms already under way, Kaczurba listed
easier access to hard currency profits, tax incentives, access
to investment credits and two devaluations of the zloty to
increase competitivity of prices.
    He said such policies had been welcomed by the World Bank
and International Monetary Fund, through which Poland is hoping
to gain new credits, but Poles were caught in a "vicious circle."
    Creditors wanted proof that the policies were directed
towards improving exports, but in order to fulfil their
expectations Poland first needed fresh inputs, he said.

<TITLE>U.S. TREASURY POLICIES SAID UNCHANGED BY DEPARTURE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Torday</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The departure of James Baker's
closest aide, Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman, will
not change the course of Washington's domestic and
international economic policies, U.S. officials said.
    Darman, who has worked alongside Baker for six years, was
widely credited with helping him mastermind initiatives on
currency management and international economic cooperation.
    U.S. Officials said Darman also played a key role in
shepherding President Reagan's sweeping tax reform plan through
the U.S. Congress.
    But they flatly dismissed suggestions that his departure,
to the investment banking firm of Shearson Lehman Brothers,
signaled the Baker team was breaking up, or that the Treasury
Secretary himself might leave soon.
    "It really does not mean that, he took the opportunity as it
came up," one official said.
    Another commented, "Baker will miss him, but he's not going
to stand in his way."
    There has been widespread speculation since last autumn
that Darman sought a Wall Street job.
    Officials said Darman felt the passage of tax reform late
last year marked an appropriate moment to bow out.
    Baker acknowledged Darman would be sorely missed.
    "Dick Darman has contributed mightily to the success of this
administration over the past six years and his departure
represents a substantial loss," he said.
    U.S. Officials admitted Darman's absence would be an
undoubted blow to Baker, who has relied on him for policy
advice, both at the White House and, in Reagan's second term,
at the Treasury. One aide once described Darman as
"indispensable" to Baker.
    Baker is widely thought to want a more stable currency
system and Darman is generally credited by officials of other
nations as Baker's leading theorist on this issue, favouring
target zones to limit currency fluctuations.
    Earlier this year, monetary sources said the U.S. Treasury
unsuccessfully sounded out allies on a target zone system.
    But a U.S. Official disputed the assessment that, with
Darman gone, Baker would abandon international initiatives.
    Baker's work as head of Reagan's Economic Policy Council,
spearheading trade policy, and his skills in negotiating with
the Democrat-controlled Congress will go on as before.
    Darman's strength was not as an economist, but as a
political strategist "and that's Baker's strength too," the
official said.
    There were already indications that Baker, who throughout
his time in government has relied on a closely-knit circle of
advisers, has moved swiftly to find a successor.
    One possibility is that Baker might turn to George Gould,
who holds the number three Treasury position of
Under-Secretary.
    Gould, another close confidante, has known Baker for years.
    Before joining the Treasury in November 1985, Gould was a
partner at the Wall Steet firm of Wertheim and Co and formerly
headed Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp.
    The Darman announcement came on the eve of the semi-annual
meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank,
where many policies Darman helped shape will be debated.
    He helped Baker devise the September, 1985 Plaza Agreement,
when the United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain
curbed the dollar's strength. The pact was a major turning
point in U.S. Policy, ending a period of disdain for economic
cooperation and intervention in currency markets.
    Darman also worked on some other Baker initiatives, like
the Tokyo Summit agreement to intensify coordination of
economic policies among the leading industrial countries and
the recent Paris Agreement to stabilise currencies and
stimulate global growth.
    These policies are collectively aimed at redressing the
huge gap between Japan and West Germany's trade surpluses and
the United State's massive trade deficit.
    That policy goal still remains a prime objective of the
Reagan Administration and will not change with Darman's
departure.

<TITLE>PORTUGUESE ECONOMY REMAINS BUOYANT DESPITE CRISIS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Pascal Fletcher, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LISBON, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Portugal's economy, which has been
enjoying one of its most buoyant periods in more than a decade,
may now be strong enough to shrug off the country's latest
government crisis, analysts said.
    But the April 3 ousting of Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco
Silva's government could slow economic reforms and investment
as Portugal continues to adapt to membership in the European
Community, which it joined in January last year, they said.
    Cavaco Silva's minority Social Democratic Party, PSD, was
toppled in a parliamentary censure vote by left-wing parties.
    The centre-right administration had made economic growth
reform a priority in its 17 months in office.
    In 1986, Portugal's economy grew four pct, its current
account surplus swelled to more than one billion dlrs and
inflation fell to 10 pct, from 20 pct in 1985.
    Analysts and businessmen said the prospects of instability
were worrying but they felt the foundations for continued
growth had not been badly shaken.
    "The economy has developed a certain self-confidence that is
now less dependent on the political situation," said Fritz
Haser, economics professor at Universidade Livre, Lisbon.
    "The market doesn't see this as a real crisis yet," economist
Jorge Braga de Macedo told Reuters.
    Businessmen have identified political instability over the
last 13 years as one of the biggest obstacles to lasting
economic progress.
    The PSD administration was the 16th formed since the 1974
revolution.
    Portugal's developing stock markets, however, remain
buoyant. Brokers and unit trust managers said the recent surge
in economic confidence under the PSD rule was still largely
underpinned by continuing optimistic forecasts.
    Investment grew nearly 10 pct in 1986 and a Bank of
Portugal forecast, released on the day the PSD government fell,
predicted the pace of investment and overall economic growth
would remain at similar levels this year.
    But analysts said the crisis interrupted current policies
and could slow economic development.
    Soares, who is expected to announce a decision by the end
of the month, can either call early elections or form a new
government from parties in the existing left wing-dominated
parliament.
    Many businessmen said they strongly favoured quick
elections as the best solution. "There is a good chance that a
majority government could result from early elections,"
Confederation of Portuguese Industry (CIP) president Pedro
Ferraz da Costa said.
    He said they were optimistic this could mean the
continuation in the near future of liberalisation policies
introduced over the last year.
    The left-wing parties favour a parliamentary solution, but
the PSD said it wants an early election in which opinion polls
say they could win an overall majority.
    A PSD majority would also open the way for more
wide-ranging reforms, such as relaxation of labour laws and
possible denationalisation of industry, the analysts said.
    Cavaco Silva has accused the left-wing opposition parties
of blocking key economic reforms.
    The left-wingers said Portugal's positive economic results
were more the product of favourable international conditions
such as cheaper oil and raw material imports, than of PSD
policies.

<TITLE>JAPANESE ECONOMIC PACKAGE SEEN AS MAJOR CHANGE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rich Miller, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The economic package unveiled yesterday by
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) marks the start of a
major shift away from the policies of the past, private
economists and government officials said.
    "A big step forward has been taken," said Industrial Bank of
Japan Ltd senior economist Susumu Taketomi.
    The package, seen as a response to mounting overseas
pressure to boost the sagging Japanese economy, calls for a
supplementary budget of more than 5,000 billion yen later this
year, plus increased imports.
    Although the measures must still gain the approval of the
Finance Ministry, economists said the government will find it
too difficult to alter the measures significantly once they
have gained domestic and overseas backing.
    "At last, the LDP and the Ministry of Finance are turning a
corner," said Sumitomo Bank Ltd's chief economist Masahiko
Koido.
    For the past five years the government has adhered to a
tight fiscal policy in its drive to stop issuing deficit
financing bonds in 1990.
    To meet that goal, spending departments are required to
submit annual budgets for current expenditure 10 pct below the
previous year and investment five pct below.
    Masayoshi Ito, chairman of the LDP's policy affairs
council, said yesterday the government must stick to its 1990
fiscal reform target, but should review the ceiling it places
on public works spending.
    Even some Finance Ministry officials privately acknowledge
that policy changes might be needed, including easing the
government's iron grip on spending.
    Economists said the government could meet its 1990 target
and also increase spending by using money it got from the sale
of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp shares and by taking
advantage of lower than expected interest rates on its debt.
Officially, the Finance Ministry is adhering to its tight
stance but some signs of change have appeared.
    "We do not have any intention of abandoning our objective to
restore fiscal balance," a Finance Ministry spokesman said.
    He said so far the ministry had tried to achieve two goals
simultaneously. These were reforming the government's fiscal
position and stimulating domestic demand.
    But the Finance Ministry spokesman added, "In looking at the
current situation of the economy and the relationship between
Japan and the United States, we feel we have to place more
emphasis on stimulating demand."
    Economists predict battles within the government over the
coming months as the Finance Ministry fights to ensure the
cracks in its policy do not lead to a complete breakdown of
fiscal discipline.
    "The Ministry is afraid that once there is a small hole in
the dike, it will lead to a flood," Industrial Bank's Taketomi
said.
    But Taketomi said the ministry, provided it has a device in
place to check excess spending for political reasons, is likely
to give the go-ahead to a shift in policy.
    "This seems to mark the first step toward a more active
fiscal policy in response to requests from the international
community," he said.
    Sumitomo's Koido said if the government quickly implements
the LDP's 5,000 billion yen package, economic growth in the
1987/88 year ending next March 31 could be around three pct,
His current forecast of 2.2 pct growth assumes a supplementary
budget of around 1,000 billion yen.

<TITLE>POLAND REASSURES CREDITORS ON ECONOMIC REFORMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STOCKHOLM, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Plans to rejuvenate Poland's economy
by reducing central government control would help reassure
Western creditors that the country's economy was safe to invest
in, a senior Polish official said.
    "The business of granting loans to Poland is not as bad a
business as you might imagine," senior Polish government
spokesman Jerzy Urban told a news conference in Stockholm.
    Urban, visiting the Swedish capital to deliver a lecture at
the Foreign Policy Institute, announced earlier this week that
Poland would soon offer shares to private citizens in state
companies in a bid to make the economy more responsive.
    This was part of a major economic reform to be announced in
the coming weeks, he said.
    Urban said the main problem with his country's foreign debt
burden of 32 billion dollars was short term interest charges
but  the long term looked more secure.
    He said he hoped talks under way with the Paris Club,
grouping Poland's main government creditors, would shortly
solve the problem of short term servicing.
    Urban told reporters that debt servicing was hampering the
expansion of the national economy, but that the new plans for
economic reform would "open new vistas for Polish exports."
    He criticised the blocking efforts of some Western
governments, whom he declined to name, for putting political
considerations ahead of economic co-operation.
    "After the lifting of U.S. Sanctions against the Polish
economy we considered all political obstacles had been removed,
but that has not been the case," Urban said.

Bergsten said a new exchange rate system is needed to replace
the fixed and flexible exchange rate systems which he said had
not worked.
    "I prefer a move to 'target zones' in which the major
countries would determine ranges of 15-20 pct within which they
would pledge to hold their exchange rates by direct
intervention and, as necessary, by changes in monetary and
other policies," Bergsten, now the director of the Institute
for International Economics, said in a statement to a House
Banking subcommittee.
    "The substantial correction of the exchange rate that has
occurred since early 1985 is enormously welcome, and should
produce a sizeable reduction in the U.S. trade deficit this
year and next, but the imbalance will not fall much below 100
billion dlrs on present policies, so much more is needed," he
said.

<TITLE>TREASURY'S CONROW PESSIMISTIC ON MDB FUNDING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Deputy Assistant Treasury Secretary
James Conrow said he was exceedingly pessimistic that Congress
will approve the Reagan administration's proposed 1988 funding
for the multilateral development banks.
    Speaking to an international development conference, Conrow
said it appears almost certain that Congress will opt to cut
spending for international programs before they cut into
domestic programs.
    He said that in such an environment "foreign aid will lose
and lose big."
    He said that this means the multilateral development bank
funding proposal will probably not "be supported and we will get
cuts."
    The administration has proposed development bank funding of
1.8 billion dlrs for fiscal year 1988. In addition, it is
seeking about 290 mln dlrs in catch-up from funding that had
been reduced in prior years.
    Conrow defended the record of the banks in recent years,
saying that they had been rightly pressing debtor countries to
reform their domestic economic policies.

to countries that the United States would like to see helped.
    Conrow said the U.S. financial commitment to the banks
allows them to substantially leverage their economic strength,
by getting assistance from other countries and by borrowing in
the capital markets.

<TITLE>BANGEMANN REJECTS CALL FOR EARLY TAX CUTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German Economics Minister Martin
Bangemann indirectly rejected a call from the country's leading
economic research institutes for early introduction of a major
tax reform involving gross tax cuts of 44 billion marks.
    In a statement reacting to the five institutes' joint
spring report, Bangemann said that as far as the call for
bringing forward the 1990 tax reform was concerned --
    "The government points out that the positive effects for
growth of its policy of consolidation (cutting the budget
deficit) must not be allowed to be endangered."
    Bangemann also recalled that the scope of tax cuts planned
for 1988 had already been increased.
    Three institutes predicted two pct economic growth in 1987,
with exports falling by 0.5 pct. The other two saw only one pct
growth and said exports would fall 2.5 pct.
    Bangemann said "The government, agreeing with the majority,
sees no reason for the extraordinarily pessimistic estimate for
exports expressed by the minority."
    He said there was reason to believe that export demand
would start to rise in the course of the year, partly because
of a further increase in world trade.

<TITLE>SPRINKEL URGES GREATER GROWTH IN JAPAN, EUROPE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOCA RATON, Fla., March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of
the president's council of economic advisors, said stronger
domestic demand growth in Japan and Western Europe is needed to
help stimulate U.S. exports without having to rely on futher
dollar declines.
    "Stronger domestic demand growth in the major foreign
industrial countries is needed to engender the much needed
expansion of U.S. export markets without having to rely on
further dollar depreciation," he told the Futures Industry
Association.
    Sprinkel said the recent recovery of domestic demand in
Japan and Europe has been one of the weakest in the post-war
period.
    "Stronger domestic demand growth in the major industrial
countries would help give balance to the current world
recovery," he said.
    Asked if Japan was not living up to commitments made last
month to trading partners, he said recent figures showed
Japan's economy grew by about 0.5 pct in the fourth quarter of
1986, "Not enough to sustain employment growth."
    However, Sprinkel said Japan had not reneged on its pledges
and was moving toward more stimulative policies, including tax
reform. "I suspect there will be further moves," he said.
    Sprinkel repeated his call for further cuts in U.S.
government spending and for resistance to tax increases.
    "Reducing the federal government budget deficit by
expenditure restraint is needed to preserve the low marginal
tax rates achieved by tax reform," he said, adding that "a vote
to increase to government expenditures is a vote against tax
reform."
    Sprinkel said the fall of the dollar had substantially
restored U.S. cost competitiveness and that the deterioration
of the U.S. trade balance appeared to have abated.
    However, he said that "sole reliance on dollar depreciation
to reduce our trade deficit is not desirable," as it risks
inflation in the United States and recession abroad.
    "I am confident that further improvements in our trade
performance will contribute significantly to growth in 1987," he
said. Improvements in the U.S. trade balance, he said, will
come about largely from a swing in manufactures trade and
present "serious adjustment problems for U.S. trading partners."
    Western Europe, where manufactures output and employment
have been weak, promises to be especially hard hit by the
improvement in the U.S. trade balance, Sprinkel said.
    He defended flexible exchange rates saying wide swings in
rates were not a fault of the system but of the undesirable
policies that produced them.

<TITLE>CHINA EXPECTED TO SHOW BIG 1986 BUDGET DEFICIT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Mark O'Neill, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>China's Finance Minister Wang Bingqian
will report a 1986 budget deficit of up to nine billion yuan
and prescribe austerity measures for 1987 in a budget speech on
Thursday, foreign bankers and diplomats told Reuters.
    Chinese officials have said the 1986 deficit is "several
billion," after a surplus of 2.82 billion in 1985 which followed
six years of deficits, including a record 17 billion yuan
shortfall in 1979. They have not given an exact figure.
    The officials blamed the deficit on excessive investment in
fixed assets and consumer demand, a drop in efficiency in state
firms, a trade deficit and lower income from import duties.
    "China needs a nationwide campaign to increase production
while cutting expenditure," the official Peking Review said in
an editorial yesterday.
    "China should institute means for the effective control of
the macro-economy and the invigoration of enterprises, larger
ones in particular, by emphasising quality, efficiency and
reduced consumption," it said.
    Only by such measures, the magazine said, "can an overall
supply-demand balance in society be secured and the economy
develop steadily over a long period."
    A Western diplomat said major factors for the deficit,
which he estimated at up to nine billion yuan, were a drop in
efficiency and wage rises in state firms, whose profits and
taxes account for a substantial part of national revenue.
    The State Statistical Bureau (SSB) last month said profits
and taxes of state firms in 1986 fell 0.2 pct from 1985 to
119.3 billion yuan, while production costs were over budget,
losses rose and product quality was unstable.
    The SSB said profits in most state firms fell because of
bad management and rapid changes in external conditions.
    "For some materials, state firms have to compete on the free
market, where prices are up to double those for materials they
buy under fixed quota from the state," the diplomat said.
    "The firms are not subject to proper market discipline,
because they cannot go bankrupt, do not have to repay bank
loans and have to employ workers whether or not they need them.
Under these conditions, they cannot properly adjust to the
economic levers the state is introducing," he said.
    Another diplomat said Wang's major problem is excess demand
in the economy, caused by wage increases well ahead of
industrial growth, and excess growth in capital construction.
    "He must dampen this growth through raising taxes or cutting
government expenditure," he said. "China's economy is inherently
unstable, either in a high or a trough."
    He said Wang will reaffirm themes repeated by leaders since
the start of the year -- thrift, improved efficiency, cutting
investment outside the state plan and reducing consumption to
bring demand and supply into balance.
    "There will be no surprises," the diplomat said.
    The first diplomat said one sign of the thrifty times was
the lack of a banquet during a visit he made to a major Chinese
industrial city.
    "Normally, a foreign guest's visit is a chance for the boys
to feast on Mao Tai (a strong liquor), turtle and sea slugs,
with one banquet given by them and one given in return by me.
But there was none on this visit," he said.
    He added economic reforms will slow this year, in
particular price changes and the issuing of shares, which raise
sensitive issues about ownership and ideology. Bond issues
raise no such dilemmas and will continue, he added.
    A North American banker, who estimated the deficit at about
eight billion yuan, said economic policy has been affected by a
national drive against "bourgeois liberalism," a phrase meaning
Western political ideas.
    "In China the political system dictates economic policy," he
said. "The large deficit gives the conservatives a stick to beat
the reformers and demand more economic austerity.
    "One of China's top economic policy makers told me this week
1987 will be a year of consolidation for his firm, with less
overseas investment, lower imports and new funding to be
sourced internally."
    The banker said he is more comfortable about China's
stability now than two months ago, when the drive was launched
after the resignation of Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang.
    "There is no leftist alternative to the reforms," he said.
"There is no going back to the policy of strict central control.
But the reforms will take years. What you have now is a
confused mix of control and market economies."

<TITLE>IADB DISPUTE HIGHLIGHTS LATIN DEBT CONFLICTS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Keith Grant, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    MIAMI, March 23 - </DATELINE><BODY>Controversy surrounding U.S.-backed
reforms in the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB)
underscores the mounting challenge to Washington's current debt
strategy, according to Latin American officials and delegates
to the IADB meeting that begins here today.
    The bank's policy-making board on Saturday postponed a
decision on the reforms until June in view of strong Latin
American opposition to U.S. Proposals to strengthen its control
over lending to the region.
    Washington wants to involve the IADB in its debt strategy
through increased lending, but as the bank's largest single
shareholder it also wants to require countries to adopt
far-reaching economic reforms to qualify for loans.
    The U.S. Push for IADB reforms, which began at last year's
meeting in Costa Rica, is particularly sensitive in an
institution Latin Americans have traditionally thought of as
their own.
    "It's almost an issue of sovereignty for the Latin
Americans," one IADB official said.
    With a 54.2 per cent voting bloc, Latin American nations
have had relatively easy access to 35 billion dlrs in project
loans since the bank's founding in 1959.
    The bank has also been run for the past 12 years by a
Mexican, Antonio Ortiz Mena, who has been increasingly critical
of U.S. Debt strategy in the last two years.
    Ortiz Mena says commercial banks must renew lending to the
region if debtors are to grow and repay creditors. At a news
conference last week he warned that Latin defaults were a
distinct possibility in the long run.
    Brazil insists its debt service obligations should in no
way interfere with growth priorities, a position putting the
issue of debt relief squarely into focus for the first time,
officials and delegates said.
    They said creditors are not ready to discuss debt
forgiveness and prefer to look at schemes such as debt-equity
swaps in combination with a continuing emphasis on economic
reforms.
    Washington wants the IADB to impose greater conditions on
lending, and has threatened to block increased appropriations
for the bank if it does not get its way.
    Latin America, while retaining reservations, now accepts
the principle of setting greater conditions on loans, but is
unwilling to countenance U.S. Demands for greater veto powers
on lending, officials and delegates said.
    Washington has pushed for veto power to be lowered to 35
pct from a simple majority as at present. Latin Americans are
unwilling to go below 40 pct, which would oblige the U.S. To
line up two other voters or voting blocs on its side.
    This attempt to weaken Latin America's voting power, and
particularly a threat by Washington to reduce funds to the IADB
unless its reforms are accepted, has created considerable
resentment among Latin Americans.
    "Debtors have already shown considerable willingness to
sacrifice over the last five years so economic adjustment is
not at issue," one Latin American official said.
    The region has been hoping for a seventh replenishment of
IADB resources of at least 20 billion dlrs for 1987-90, as
against 15.7 billion for the previous four-year period.

<TITLE>WORLD BANK PRESIDENT OPPOSES DEBT FORGIVENESS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>World Bank President Barber Conable
said he opposed forgiving developing countries' debt because
the proposal, if adopted, would lead to a cutoff in lending to
the indebted countries.
    "I think (debt) forgiveness will simply create an
environment in which no more money will go into development and
a lot of the world will be consigned to poverty and to
instability indefinitely," he told ABC Television on Sunday.
    A number of bills have been introduced in Congress that
would require commercial banks to forgive a least a portion of
the debt owed them by cash-starved developing countries.
    "I think we've got to find ways of encouraging continuous
improvement in policies, of wise use of money in short, rather
than trying to turn everybody off," Conable said.
    Conable told ABC's "Business World" he supported Treasury
Secretary James Baker's debt plan as an "andidote to debt."
    Baker has said the best way to reduce the developing
countries' debt burden is to boost their growth rates through
reformed domestic policies and increased commercial bank
lending.

<TITLE>TREASURY'S BAKER SEES INCREASED TAX COMPLIANCE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Secretary James Baker said
that over the long-term the tax reform bill and lower marginal
tax rates should increase compliance with the tax law and bring
in additional revenue.
    In testimony before a senate appropriations subcommittee
Baker said no savings in the Treasury's budgetary requirements
wil be achieved in the short-run by the new tax law.
    "The tax changes occurring in 1987 and 1988 under tax reform
will not directly effect IRS enforcement activities until
financial year 1989 and 1990."
    He told the subcommittee that the Treasury's objective was
to strengthen the capability of the Internal Revenue Service to
promote tax compliance and generate revenue.
    He said they were seeking funds to increase staffing to
reduce the backlog of delinquent tax accounts, reducing pending
tax litigation cases under appeal, and resolving unreported
income cases disclosed through a program that matches third
party documents to returns.
    "This request will continue our effort to build a stronger
and more credible deterrent against non-compliance with tax
laws," he said.
    Baker also told the subcommittee that the administration
would continue the efforts to improve the management of the
government's cash and credit, and its financial information.
     In addition a policy of full reimbursement to Federal
Reserve Banks for the fiscal agent services they provide in
marketing and maintaining Treasury securities will be
continued.

<DATELINE>    HARARE, April 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>A range of substantial policy
initiatives need to be implemented to shift resources from
consumption to production in the Zimbabwe economy, says the
Zimbabwe Banking Corporation (ZBC) in its quarterly economic
review.
    The state owned banking group says although Zimbabwe's
balance of payments improved significantly last year the
underlying position deteriorated. Last year's improved trade
surplus was partly the result of sales of stockpiled gold and
continued import restraint.
    It says debt service charges are projected to exceed 35 pct
of exports in 1987 and warns against squeezing imports further.
    ZBC says mining industry import quotas for the first six
months of 1987 have been halved and those for manufacturing
industry cut by a third.
    It contrasts the performance of manufacturing industry in
1967 to 1974, with that since independence in 1980. Industrial
production almost doubled between 1967 and 1974, when foreign
currency allocations almost trebled in real terms.
    Since 1980, import allocations have been cut 45 pct and the
Zimbabwe dollar has depreciated by more than 60 pct. As a
result the bank says the external purchasing power of foreign
currency allocations is currently only 20 pct of its 1980
levels.

<TITLE>BAKER URGES SUPPORT FOR DEVELOPMENT BANKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Secretary James Baker urged
Congress to support the administration's financing requests for
the multilateral development banks in the next two fiscal
years.
    Baker told a House appropriations subcommittee the
administration's request for a total 2.1 billion dlrs in fiscal
1987 and 1988 would meet administration shortfalls and fulfill
Washington's annual payment responsibilities.
    In testimony that went over much of the same ground as his
remarks to a Senate committee some two weeks ago, Baker said
support for the MDBs was crucial to U.S. economic leadership.
    Baker told the committee, "Our national self respect and
our international leadership depend on our willingness to
fulfill this responsibility."
    The administration budget requests include a supplemental
request for fiscal 1987 of 293 mln dlrs and a 1.8 billion dlr
request for fiscal 1988.
    Baker noted these requests included funding requirements
negotiated by the administration with this committee.
    Baker's remarks outlined why the development banks were
formed and the stake the U.S. had in maintaining them.
    Baker pointed out the U.S. has successfully sought reforms
in several of the institutions and was pressing for reforms in
others aimed at making them more efficient, with policies
oriented toward free markets.
    He also gave the House subcommittee a progress report on
the debt strategy and emphasized the importance of continued
financing for the MDBs if the U.S. is to continue to lead in
resolving the debt crisis.
    In other remarks, Baker repeated the need to finance the
general foreign affairs budget and underscored how MDBs have
served U.S. national interests.

<TITLE>U.S ENERGY SECRETARY PROPOSES OIL TAX INCENTIVES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Energy Secretary John Herrington
said he will propose tax incentives to increase domestic oil
and natural gas exploration and production to the Reagan
Administration for consideration.
    "These options boost production, while avoiding the huge
costs associated with proposals like an oil import fee,"
Herrington told a House Energy subcommittee hearing. "It is my
intention to submit these proposals to the domestic policy
council and the cabinet for consideration and review."
    He said proposals, including an increase in the oil
depletion allowance and repeal of the windfall profits tax,
should be revenue neutral and promote domestic production at
the least cost to the economy and the taxpayers.
    "The goal of the Administration policies is to increase
domestic production. I would like to shoot for one mln barrels
a year."
    The proposals were based on a DOE study released yesterday
warning the United States was threatened by a growing
dependence on oil imports.
    "We project free world dependence on Persian Gulf oil at 65
pct by 1995," Herrington said.
    He said it was too soon to say what the Administration
policy on oil tax incentives would be and indicated there would
be opposition to tax changes.
    "Of course, to move forward with these kinds of options
would require reopening tax issues settled last year (in the
tax reform bill) -- an approach which has not, in general, been
favored by the administration. I think what we need is to
debate this within the Administration," he said.
    He said the proposals might raise gasoline prices.
    Herrington did not specifically confirm a report in today's
Washington Post that he had written to President Reagan urging
an increase in the oil depletion allowance.
    Asked about the report by subcommittee members, Herrington
said various proposals were under consideration and would be
debated within the Administration to determine which would have
the most benefits at the least cost.

<TITLE>BAKER SEEKS MORE BANK LOANS TO DEVELOPING NATIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Secretary James Baker said
banks must do more lending to developing countries.
    Baker, in an interview on Cable News Network, was asked
about such loans after Standard and Poor's Corp today
downgraded the debt of six major money centre bank holding
companies, largely because of their heavy loan exposure to
developing nations.
    Baker said developing countries must adopt free market
economic policies such as that of the United States. He said
capital flows will be required to support the needed reforms in
those countries' economic systems.
    The money must come either through equity or debt and Baker
said developing nations' "investment regimes do not support
enough equity investment, so you've got to have some debt
there."

<TITLE>CANADA OUTLINES GATT AGRICULTURAL REFORM PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TAUPO, New Zealand, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canadian Trade Minister Pat
Carney said that agricultural policies should not hurt world
international trade and should therefore become more price
responsive over time.
    She told delegates at the informal meeting of trade
ministers that this was one of five principles Canada wanted
adopted in reforming agriculture in the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Secondly, support for agriculture
should avoid production incentives, and thirdly, countries
should freeze and seek to reduce government aid measures that
distorted world prices, Carney said.
    Carney said the fourth principle was that countries should
not introduce new import barriers not mandated by existing
legislation and the fifth was that these basic principles must
be implemented collectively.
    Carney later told Reuters the Canadian guidelines are
basically compatible with the seven point Australian proposals
announced in Davos, Switzerland, in January.
    European trade sources said the conference welcomed the
Canadian initiative but some delegates, and not only the
European Community, voiced reservations about some of the
principles.
    Carney said there was a lot of political will among the
ministers here to complete the Uruguay Round of GATT in under
four years and that there is also a realisation that it has to
be done in a balanced way.
    "The consensus view was to proceed as fast as we can on a
broad front and see what areas emerge where we can get early
conclusion," she said.
    However, the meeting did not identify what those areas are,
Carney said.  She said Canada/U.S. Bilateral trade
negotiations, which must be concluded at least in draft form by
October, are progressing well.

<DATELINE>    Washington, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Senator Kent Conrad, D-ND, said
President Reagan's goal of phasing-out world farm subsidies by
the year 2000 is doomed to failure because the European
Community, EC, will not accept it.
    "It (Reagan plan) is a nonstarter. Its absolutely crystal
clear they (EC) have no intention of eliminating subsidies,"
said Conrad on his return from a four-day visit to Europe.
    Instead of proposing an end to farm subsidies, he said the
U.S. should adopt some of the EC Common Agricultural Policy,
CAP, principles by seeking a "compromise" agreement with
Brussels to jointly reduce production, and apply a two-price
system of high domestic and low export prices. Under the plan,
export subsidies would bridge domestic and world price gaps,
said Conrad, a new member of the Senate Agriculture Committee.

<TITLE>OIL TAX BREAK RIDICULED BY U.S. HOUSE TAXWRITER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>A House taxwriter said Energy
Secretary James Herrington's "outrageous" plan to restore an old
tax break for oil companies was both bad tax and energy policy.
    Rep. Pete Stark, a California Democrat and senior House
Ways and Means Committee member, said Herrington's plan for a
27.5 pct depletion allowance--which in effect is a special 27.5
pct tax deduction --would cost seven billion dlrs a year.
    "He must have missed the last two years of federal tax
reform by sleeping as soundly as Rip Van Winkle," Stark said.
    He said in a statement the oil industry already pays an
effective lower rate of U.S. tax on investment, 15 pct versus
aggregate corporate tax on all investment of 34 pct, according
to a recent Congressional Research Service study.

<TITLE>U.S. URGED TO STRENGTHEN DEBT STRATEGY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Torday, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Several industrial nations are
pressing the United States to consider whether its debt
strategy, under increasing fire in the developing world, needs
to be strengthened, monetary sources say.
    While few nations are ready to pour vast sums of money into
radical "debt relief" style solutions to the debt crisis,
pressure is building for a greater International Monetary Fund
role in the plan.
    But U.S. officials, who are fighting off demands for change
by Congress, are confident they will retain support for their
strategy which will probably be endorsed in a communique
issued by the IMF's policy-making Interim Committee.
    One Reagan administration official said a recent discussion
among leading industrial countries showed there was "very broad
and strong support for continuing the strategy".
    The official said in an interview, "I don't sense that
there's a strong desire to revise the debt strategy, except of
course here on (Capitol) Hill."
    But monetary sources said some industrial nations, like
France and Italy, are troubled by signs the strategy is
increasingly strained. Britain too is said to be concerned.
    In late 1985, Washington called on multilateral development
banks, like the World Bank, and commercial banks to increase
loans to the 15 major debtors by 29 billion dlrs over three
years.
    In return, the major debtors were expected to undertake
reforms promoting inflation-free economic growth, more open
markets and a reduced government role in the economy.
    The IMF was to retain a "central role" in the strategy,
shifting its economic reform programs from emphasizing
austerity to stressing growth, freer trade policies and foreign
investment in debtor nations.
    But monetary sources said some nations want even more
flexibility from the IMF when it sets economic programs tied to
loans for debtor nations.
    Such flexibility would include less rigid economic targets
-- which often lead to artificial crises when they are not met
-- and more reliance on ranges and benchmarks to monitor
economic performance.
    There is also concern that the level of IMF lending is too
low and the commercial banks, themselves under attack for
tawdry loan levels to debtors, want to see it increased.
    The IMF, which holds its semi-annual meetings with the
World Bank next week, will only be a small net lender this
year. Much of its loan disbursements are offset by repayments.
    Meanwhile, most countries, including the United States,
acknowledge the banks have not lived up to their commitments.
    Paul Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, is 
particularly irritated with the reluctance of commercial banks
to lend more to reforming debtors, monetary sources say.
    New IMF managing director Michel Camdessus is understood to
be worried about the Fund's image in the developing world,
where it is often depicted as the source of economic ills.
    Camdessus' experience as former chairman of the so-called
"Paris Club" of western creditor governments, has given him
extensive first-hand experience of the debt crisis.
    Brazil, which in February declared an interest paymernts
moratorium on 67 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt, has
flatly ruled out adopting a program of IMF-sponsored economic
reforms. Peru too has rejected an IMF program, curbing debt
repayments to 10 pct of exports.
    But the administration official said Brazil's strategy of
using a moratorium as a negotiating tool might backfire. "It's
probably turning out to be more complicated than they thought.
It underlines the extreme risk that a debtor country takes on
itself when it begins down that road," the official said.
    Indeed, U.S. banks are laying the groundwork for writing
down their Brazilian loans.
    U.S. officials have generally praised most debtors for
adopting genuine economic reforms and the multilateral
institutions for stepping up their lending.
    And they point out that Venezuela, Chile and the
Philippines have struck agreement with commercial banks
stretching out debt repayments.
    But problems still dog assembly of a 7.7 billion dlrs bank
loan for Mexico, which many officials acknowledge may be the
last major cash loan for a debtor country.
    Instead, banks are being pressed to come up with more novel
ways of easing the liquidity squeeze in debtor nations.
    The prospect of greater official involvement in the debt
strategy depends chiefly on the ability of western nations to
come up with more finance.
    While there is sympathy in Congress for various forms of
debt relief, more U.S. funds for the World Bank or the IMF are
a virtual impossibility in today's era of budget restraint.
    That leaves rich surplus nations like Japan and West
Germany, but neither country favors generalized debt relief.
    And the Reagan administration is not inclined to bow to
Congressional pressure for changes in regulations governing
foreign loans, to make it easier for banks to account for
delays in interest and principal repayments.

<TITLE>WORLD BANK LIKELY TO URGE CHANGES ON JAKARTA</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jeremy Clift, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 22 - </DATELINE><BODY>World Bank President Barber Conable is
expected to press Indonesia, the Third World's sixth largest
debtor, to maintain the momentum of economic policy changes to
tackle the slump in its oil revenues, western diplomats said.
    Conable, who flew to Indonesia yesterday from Tokyo, will
meet with President Suharto and senior economic ministers.
    He said on arrival that the economy of South-East Asia's
largest nation was being managed well, but the slump in world
oil prices called for major policy adjustments.
    Today the World Bank chief will visit Bank-funded projects
in the eastern section of Java, Indonesia's most populous
island. He will see Suharto on Tuesday after a day of detailed
discussions with ministers tomorrow.
    Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC, has been severely
hit by last year's crash in oil prices, which cut its oil and
gas revenues in half.
    Japan's state Export-Import Bank last month agreed to
provide around 900 mln dlrs in untied credits to help Indonesia
pay for its share of 21 World Bank development projects.
    Indonesia, a country of 168 mln people, has responded to
the oil slump by cutting spending, devaluing its currency by 31
pct, and trying to boost exports, while using foreign loans to
bridge its deficit.
    Diplomats said that Conable was expected to press Suharto
and leading economic ministers to maintain the pace of policy
change, particularly in dismantling Indonesia's high-cost
protected economy.
    "Oil prices, the debt crisis, the world recession, all call
for major policy adjustments and external support," Conable said
in his arrival statement.
    But with Indonesia facing parliamentary elections next
month, he is likely to avoid anything which would imply that
the Bank is demanding specific changes.
    "We believe there has been wise leadership here and the
economy is being very well managed," Conable told reporters at
Jakarta airport.
    Indonesia has official and private overseas debts totalling
37 billion dlrs, according to the Bank, which makes it the
Third World's sixth biggest debtor. It has received 10.7
billion dlrs from the World Bank since 1968.
    Conable did not spell out what further changes he would
like to see. Last month the Bank endorsed economic changes
already introduced by Indonesia, but implied it wanted more.
    Giving a 300 mln dlr loan in balance of payments support,
the Bank said it will monitor progress on implementation of the
government's trade reform measures, and supported its
determination to promote efficiency and longer-term growth.
    Indonesia has introduced a series of measures since last
May to boost non-oil exports, liberalise trade and encourage
outside investment.
    Suharto has also ordered a government committee to look
into which of Indonesia's 215 state-run companies could be
sold.
    But in a report last month, the U.S. Embassy said the
government appeared divided over how far to take its reforms.
    Western analysts say that in particular the government is
unsure how far to go with dismantling Indonesia's high-cost
monopolies, which control core areas of the economy.
    Central bank governor Arifin Siregar said this week that
Indonesia faced very limited economic choices.
    It could not spend its way out of trouble because this
would increase the balance of payments deficit and domestic
inflation.
     He said the main objective was to raise exports outside
the oil and natural gas sector.
    Indonesia's current account deficit is projected by the
government to fall to 2.64 billion dlrs in the coming financial
year which starts on April 1, from an estimated 4.1 billion in
1986/87.

<DATELINE>    ROME, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>World output of staple foods maintained
growth in 1986, following a record harvest the year before, and
most of the increase was in developing countries, the director
general of the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)
said.
    Speaking to FAO's committee on world food security, Edouard
Saouma said sub-Saharan Africa registered a cereal production
increase of 3.6 pct in 1986 and the Far East also continued to
increase production.
    Despite ample supplies worldwide, many countries face
problems in paying for all the food they need, he said.
    Saouma said many of the developing world's food problems
were the result of "chaotic" world trade.
    He said it was vital to promote employment to improve the
"food-security situation" of the poor, with policy reforms in
developing countries to remove existing disincentives to
production so that agriculture could play a greater role in
stimulating economic growth.

<TITLE>UK MINISTER SAYS FARM TALKS CAN USE OECD STUDY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.K. Agriculture Minister Michael
Jopling said an OECD study which calculates the level of
domestic farm subsidies in industrial countries would be a good
basis for global agriculture negotiations now underway.
    The controversial study, which has not yet been released by
the Paris-based OECD, has calculated a measure of farm
subsidies called the the Producer Subsidy Equivalent, PSE, OECD
sources in Paris said last month.
    Jopling, in a speech to the Commodity Club yesterday,
suggested the PSE be refined as a starting point for reducing
domestic farm policies during the Uruguay round of trade
negotiations begun under the world trade agreement GATT.
    The OECD study shows that there are few countries which do
not significantly subsidize farmers, Jopling said.
    The OECD study attempts to measure all farm subsidies for
the years 1979 through 1981.
    Jopling qualified his endorsement of the PSE as a
negotiating tool, however, by saying the European Community
would want "credit" in the negotiations for recent actions
taken to reform the Common Agricultural Policy.
    Representatives of other industrial countries told Reuters
they are more skeptical than the U.K. about the PSE concept.
    An Australian trade official said Canberra has "grave
technical reservations" about the use of the PSE calculations.
U.S. officials said there are several shortcomings to the study
including the necessity to update the calculations to reflect
recent changes in farm programs worldwide.
    The officials said the study may be released in May.

<TITLE>JAPAN FINISHING UP WORK ON SUPPLEMENTARY BUDGET</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rich Miller, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Finance Ministry is putting the
finishing touches on a roughly 2,000 billion yen supplementary
budget for 1987/88 and has started to turn its attention to
next year's main budget, ministry officials said.
    The supplementary budget is designed to help finance the
6,000 billion yen emergency economic package the government
unveiled last month to boost domestic demand.
    Ministry officials said the government would issue about
1,300 billion yen in construction bonds to help pay for the
increased public investment set out in the emergency package.
    The rest of the supplementary budget will be financed by
450 billion yen in proceeds from last year's sale of shares in
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT) and by higher than
expected 1986/87 tax revenues, officials said.
    One official said the carry-over of tax revenues into the
1987/88 fiscal year that began on April 1 might be more than
1,000 billion yen. Soaring land and share prices have boosted
receipts, especially from securities and land taxes.
    With less than half of the carry-over likely to be used in
the current supplementary budget, the rest will be available
for a second supplementary budget expected later this year.
    The second supplementary budget will be used to finance the
government's wage bill, which will not be known until after
wage talks later this year, one official said.
    The government must also finance the tax cut of more than
1,000 billion yen which it promised in its emergency package
but which will not be contained in the first supplementary
budget, due to be presented to parliament next month.
    The Finance Ministry's budget bureau is hoping the tax
carry-over and higher than expected revenues again this year
will be enough to finance the second supplementary budget, he
said.
    Officials said the Finance Ministry does not want to issue
deficit-financing bonds or use the extra proceeds from this
year's NTT share sale to fund the second supplementary budget.
    Besides the first supplementary budget, the government also
intends to introduce a new tax reform bill to parliament during
the upcoming extraordinary session, officials said.
    The government was forced to abandon its first tax reform
bill due to strong opposition to its plan to introduce a five
pct sales tax.
    The sales tax was designed to help finance cuts in
individual and corporate income taxes.
    The new bill will present the 1,000 billion yen-plus tax
cut contained in the emergency package as the first step to an
overhaul of the country's tax system, officials said.
    It will also contain a controversial plan to phase out tax
breaks on savings, although it may not take effect in October
as originally planned, they said.
    Looking ahead to next year's main budget, the Finance
Ministry is beginning to debate whether to abandon its
so-called minus ceiling for public investment.
    That policy calls on government departments to cut public
investment spending by five pct per year.
    Economic Planning Minister Tetsuo Kondo said recently the
policy would be suspended in 1988/89, pending a recommendation
from the government's administrative reform council.
    The ruling Liberal Democratic Party said in April that
budget request guidelines for invesment expenditures would be
reviewed.
    But some officials at the Finance Ministry's budget bureau
said they were hopeful the policy would be retained.
    They fear that a suspension of the guidelines for public
investment could lead to increased pressure on the government
to loosen its grip on current expenditures as well.
    The account would also extend interest-free loans to
profitable public works projects developed in conjunction with
the private sector, the officials said.
    In this way, the Finance Ministry could meet growing
pressure on it to boost capital spending while maintaining a
tight grip on outlays by other government departments.
    Surplus funds from this year's sale of NTT shares could
total about 3,000 billion yen. Based on the current market
price, the planned sale of 1.95 mln shares would raise more
than 5,000 billion yen, compared to about 2,000 billion planned
for in the main 1987/88 budget.

<TITLE>REPORT SAYS SOVIET ECONOMIC PLANS TOO OPTIMISTIC</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    by Robert Green, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Soviet economy has grown at an
increased rate under Mikhail Gorbachev's leadership, but his
goals may be too ambitious, according to a report from U.S.
intelligence agencies.
    The report was prepared jointly by the Central Intelligence
Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency for the
Congressional Joint Economic committee, which released it.
    It said the Soviet economy grew by 4.2 pct in 1986,
Gorbachev's first full year in power, twice the average rate of
growth over the previous 10 years.
    Gorbachev's policies to improve worker attitudes, remove
incompetent officials, reduce corruption and alcoholism and
modernize the country's industrial equipment accounted for some
of the gains, the report said.
    "Although many of the specific policies Gorbachev has
adopted are not new, the intensity Gorbachev has brought to his
efforts and his apparent commitment to finding long-term
solutions are attributes that his immediate predecessors
lacked. Nonetheless, Gorbachev's program appears too ambitious
on a number of counts," the report said.
    Earlier this week, two U.S. experts on the Soviet Union
said Gorbachev was likely to be ousted in three to four years
if he continues his reform policies.
    "I don't think he can last four years," Marshall Goldman of
Harvard University told a Congressional hearing. "He's moving so
fast, he's stepping on so many toes."
    A similar comment came from Peter Reddaway of the
Smithsonian Institution's Kennan Institute for Advanced Russian
studies.
    The economic report said meeting targets for commodity
output would require unrealistic gains in productivity and
industrial output targets appear too high to allow time to
install more advanced equipment.
    None of Gorbachev's proposals would change the system of
economic incentives that has discouraged innovation and
technological change, the report added.
    "The first significant resistance to specific policies,
although not overall goals, surfaced (in 1986) in both the
massive government and party bureaucracy, particularly among
enterprise managers who complained that they were being asked
to carry out conflicting goals -- such as to raise quality
standards and output targets simultaneously," the report said.
    The CIA-DIA report predicted two to three pct growth in the
Soviet economy over the next several years. It said the Soviet
Union trailed the U.S. by seven to 12 years in advanced
manufacturing technologies, such as computers and
microprocessors.

<TITLE>EAST GERMANY ANNOUNCES ECONOMIC REFORM PLANS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    EAST BERLIN, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>East Germany plans to devolve more
responsibility to factories and boost profitability under a law
obliging plants to generate their own funds for investments in
new machinery, repairs or expansion, the Berliner Zeitung
newspaper said.
    The state would no longer finance projects under five mln
marks under the law which took effect on January 1.
    The paper also hinted at further, more ambitious changes if
this experiment proved successful.
    Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has cited East Germany's
cautious industrial decentralisation as an alternative to the
Hungarian model based on Western-style market economics.
    The law stresses that East Germany remains committed to the
centralised state-planned economic system with no market
experiments.
    "This new regulation is part of our general investment
policy," Berliner Zeitung said, citing the growing importance of
robots and high technology rather than the large-scale plant
construction of the 1950s and 1960s.
    "This step could be the start of even greater changes in GDR
investment policy. We must wait and see," it added.
    Factory investment funds would be drawn from profits above
certain minimum returns pledged to the state under annual plans
and from amortisation -- funds the factory is allowed to keep
to compensate for depreciation in the cost of machinery.
    Amortisation costs and all profits currently go back to the
state, which provides all investment capital in return.
    This centralisation has hindered management's response to
changes in world markets vital for the East German economy,
economists said.

<TITLE>OECD WARNS SWEDEN ON LABOUR COSTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, April 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>High labour costs and slower corporate
investment could hinder Sweden's economic growth after 1987,
the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development,
OECD, said.
    The Swedish economy grew at a slower rate in 1986 than in
previous years. GDP rose about 1.7 pct in 1986 compared with
2.2 pct in 1985. But this growth depended largely on external
factors, particularly lower oil prices, the OECD secretariat
said in its latest annual report on Sweden.
    It warned that labour costs had risen more rapidly in
Sweden than in other OECD countries.
    Because of high labour costs Swedish industry, which
largely relies upon export markets, was losing market share.
Wages in the manufacturing sector grew by seven pct in 1986, in
line with 1985 increases, while public sector wages rose an
estimated 9.2 pct in 1986, up from six pct in 1985.
    This was significantly higher than average wage increases
of 3.75 pct for the seven largest members of the OECD in 1986.
    The report said wage moderation was central to maintaining
economic growth in Sweden. It suggested that wage negotiations
should be at least partly centralised to control the total
wages bill and hold down inflation and unemployment levels.
    Helped by low oil prices and the government's tight fiscal
policy, inflation fell to just over three pct in 1986 from
almost six pct in 1985 but remained higher than in most other
OECD countries, the report said.
    Unemployment, a principal policy target, was at 2.7 pct in
1986, in line with 1985's 2.8 pct and well below the OECD
average of 8.6 pct. The report said Sweden's employment
policies accounted for the high levels of wage inflation.
    It also said that economic growth in 1986 relied
increasingly on private consumption because corporate
investment in machinery and equipment had shrunk.
    The total volume of industrial investments dropped by two
pct in 1986, with sharp declines in spending by the wood, pulp
and paper industries. This compared to a 19 pct rise in 1985
when there was heavy investment in these industries.
    The OECD said Sweden should now make an effort to boost
corporate investments and reduce its dependence on domestic
consumption for economic growth. It suggested there was room
for reform in the tax system.
    Sweden should continue to cut public sector spending,
especially in local government, to keep in line with its
tighter fiscal policy, the report said.

<TITLE>PAPER INSTITUTE SEES STRONG PAPER MARKET IN '87</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The American Paper Institute said the
industry is headed for another year of record volume in 1987,
with linerboard particularly strong.
    "A pro-growth trade policy, continued attention to currency
management, a fairly low interest rate climate and no major tax
increases are the essential ingredients in this outlook," Red
Cavaney, American Paper Institute president said.
    Cavaney said that so far this year the industry's
performance mimics last year's strength.
    Last year, he said, paper and paperboard production hit a
record 71 mln tons, 5.9 pct above 1985's 67 mln tons, while
industry after-tax profits in 1986 exceeded 1985 profits.
    Cavaney said that inventories will play a major role in
this year's performance.
    "Inventories, which are generally low, are a positive
factor in the industry's outlook this year," he said, citing
market pulp stocks, which are currently at 21 days supply, at
the low end of the industry's long term average.
    Cavaney added that as a result of slimmer inventories in
1986 and in the early part of this year, shipments for 1987 as
a whole will be higher than last year, even if demand slackens.
    Cavaney said, however, he expects demand this year to be
strong, spurred by consumer spending.
    The benefits of tax reform on individual after-tax income
and consumer goods companies' cash flow, he said, will increase
demand for both communications paper and packaging this year.
    In addition, Cavaney said low mortgage rates should support
high levels of housing starts in 1987, increasing demand for
many kinds of packaged goods.
    Inventory building should help demand for cartons and
corrugated containers this year, he added.
    Cavaney said he expects exports to remain fairly high in
1987, as well, as a result of the recent declines in the dollar
against major world currencies.
    But more importantly, he said, an improved balance of trade
in 1987 from the lower dollar would induce increased industrial
activity at home and thus higher packaging demand.
    Cavaney said increased competitiveness, caused by lower
costs, higher productivity and improved efficiency would also
contribute to a strong showing from the industry this year.
    Cavaney said, however, that the Tax Reform Act of 1986
could have a negative impact on the industry this year.
    "For manufacturers, the removal of the investment tax
credit creates an impediment to future investment," he said.
    Also, he said API estimates the industry will lose three
billion dlrs in cash flow over a five year period as a result
of reforms.
    "Adjustments to this loss will require time and careful
evaluation and will adversely affect the capital spending
decisions of individual companies," Cavaney said.

<TITLE>EC MINISTERS BID TO SAVE DAIRY ACCORD</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jonathan Clayton, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>European Community (EC) farm ministers
were fighting hard early today to prevent a deal on cutting
overflowing milk production from turning sour before trying to
agree widescale reforms in other surplus sectors.
    Meanwhile, protests from angry European farmers over
successive attempts to scale down unwanted Community food
production appeared to be gathering strength.
    In the northeastern Spanish city of Saragossa thousands of
Spanish farmers battled with police during a march to demand a
better deal from Brussels.
    The farmers traded stones for tear gas and rubber pellets
and occupied local government buildings while in the southern
city of Malaga, citrus growers dumped more 20 tonnes of lemons
on the streets in protest at EC duties.
    Towards the end of last week, about 10,000 angry West
German farmers marched through the streets of Hanover burning
effigies of Agriculture Minister Ignaz Kiechle while in France
pig-farmers barricaded roads in protest at falling prices.
    Europe's 12 mln farmers are furious over plans by the
European Commission to cut subsidised prices and severely limit
farmers' automatic right to sell unwanted food into public
stores at high guaranteed EC prices.
    In the toughest-ever proposals for the annual price review,
at which EC ministers set the levels of subsidies, Agriculture
Commissioner Frans Andriessen has included measures that could
result in price cuts for some products of up to 11 pct.
    The plans form part of an on-going campaign to reform
surplus-creating farm policies that have become a political
embarrassment at home and commercial flash-point abroad and
threatened to leave the Community with no cash for other areas.
    Andriessen's latest package comes only months after a
decision to cut dairy production by 9.5 pct over two years and
to slash beef prices by around 10 pct.
    That decision, agreed in outline last December after
virtually nine days of non-stop negotiations, was hailed as the
most significant step yet in the reform offensive, but has
since run into difficulties over the fine print.
    West Germany and Ireland are objecting to the new rules
governing the sales of surplus butter into cold stores, but the
Commission is loathe to abandon its position as the accord has
been used as the inspiration for Andriessen's latest package.
    Ministers failed yesterday to overcome the problem, and
resumed negotiations in a bid to finalise the details before
starting the price review which is confidently predicted to
last many months.
    EC farm spending currently swallows two thirds of an
overall annual budget of around 40 billion dlrs and is almost
entirely blamed for a projected budget shortfall later this
year of some 5.7 billion dlrs.

<TITLE>REAGAN SETS FIRM RULES FOR NATIONAL SECURITY STAFF</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan made public a
detailed set of orders to his national security staff designed
to prevent scandals similar to the Iran arms affair.
    In a message to Congress accompanying National Security
Decision Directive (NSDD) 266, Reagan said: "(The reforms) are
evidence of my determination to return to proper procedures,
including consultation with the Congress."
    NSDDs are normally classified. Officials said this was the
first time the duties of the national security staff had been
spelled out in such a document since the National Security
Council (NSC) was set up by Congress 40 years ago.
    The orders implement the recommendations of the Tower
Commission, named by the president to investigate the secret
U.S. Arms sales to Iran and led by former Senator John Tower.
    In a scathing report on February 26, the panel blasted the
conduct of the NSC staff and criticised the president for being
unaware of many of the activities of his subordinates.
    Reagan accepted the report's conclusions in a speech on
March 4 and said he had barred NSC staff from conducting covert
operations. The prohibition is laid out in NSDD 266 which calls
for a "small, highly competent (NSC staff) broadly experienced
in the making of national security policy."
    NSDD 266 said the organization should impose "clear vertical
lines of control and accountability."
    The eight page document said the NSC's use of private
individuals and organisations as intermediaries to conduct
covert activities would be "appropriately limited and subject to
close observation."
    It said the NSC staff should include a legal adviser who
would have access to all information. The national security
adviser should initiate periodic reassessments of policies and
operations and ensure that consultations and presidential
decisions are adequately recorded, it said.

<TITLE>TREASURY'S BAKER CALLS FOR MORE BANK FLEXIBILITY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Secretary James Baker said
that commercial banks need to develop more flexibility in their
concerted lending mechanisms "to help assure continued
participation in new money packages."
    He said that major debtor nations need to be able to count
on receiving timely disbursements on new loans essential to
support well-conceived economic programs.
    His remarks were made to the afternoon session of the
International Monetary Fund's policy making Interim Committee.
    Baker said, "The sense of urgency and willingness to
cooperate in support of a larger general interest that helped
to carry us through the difficult crisis period of 1982 and
1983 is now less evident."
    He said to address this problem, it is important for the
commercial banks to "develop a menu of alternative new money 
options from which all banks with debt exposure can choose in
providing continuing support for debtor reforms."
    He said the "continued implementation of the debt strategy
may well rest on their doing so."
    Baker also said that growth prospects for the lowest income
countries remain an issue of "critical concern to the United
States."
    He said that he intended to address the problem of poor
country prospects in greater detail at tomorrow's meeting of
the joint IMF-World Bank Devlopment Committee.
    Baker said, however, that ministers should guard against
what appear to be magical solutions to the complex debt
problem.
    "I want to stress the need for all to guard against the
ephemeral attraction of magical solutions, which may appear as
tantalizing alternatives to the rigorous realities of grappling
with our debt problems," he said.
    But he emphasized that the only lasting progress is to
approach each situation on a case-by-case basis, "bringing to
bear the policies and financing needed to bring the economy
back to sustained economic growth."

<TITLE>CANADA SEEKS FIVE YEAR FARM REFORM PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canada will propose at the new round of
international trade talks that most trade-distorting farm
subsidies be phased out over a five year period, Trade Minister
Pat Carney said.
    "Agricultural subsidies and trade barriers have created a
vicious circle which continues to cause problems of
overproduction and low commodity prices," Carney told the House
of Commons.
    Carney was outlining the government's new position on the
farm trade problem that was tabled on Tuesday in Geneva in the
multilateral talks under the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade).
    While few details were released, Carney said the government
would also be pressing for an improvement in market access and
new measures to ensure countries do not erect artificial
barriers.
    "Under the Canadian proposal, all countries would have to
ensure that domestic policies and programs to address the
specific needs of their farm sectors do not distort trade," a
government background paper said.
    "Furthermore, in assessing the trade impact of programs,
credit could be given to countries which effectively control
the output of farm products," the papers said.

<TITLE>DELORS REPORTS STRONG OBJECTIONS TO EC CASH PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STRASBOURG, France, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>European Community
Commission President Jacques Delors said he met with strong
objections from some EC government heads to his radical plan
for changes to Community financing.
    In a speech to the European Parliament, Delors said some EC
leaders told him on a recent tour they could not easily allow
additional resources for the bloc when they were themselves
pruning their own spending.
    Others called for major spending cut in the EC's
controversial farm policy in order to free money for regional
and social development.
    The Parliament later registered its support for the Delors
plan by voting to approve his continuation in office for a
second two-year term.
    Delors has proposed that payments by member states to the
EC should be based on their gross national product instead of
on the amount of value added tax they receive. He said this
would increase EC resources and provide a fairer system of
sharing the financial burden.
    He told the Parliament that in reply to complaints about
increased payments, he had told some heads of government the
Community needs more money.
    Delors said he agreed with leaders who argued the need to
reform the EC farm policy, which currently accounts for over
two thirds of the 41 billion dlr annual budget."We have to ask
for sacrifices but we have to create a future for those
farmers."
    He added, "I was forced to say to some heads of government -
Do you want to destroy this common market in agriculture when
you are asking for a common market in goods and services?"
    EC leaders have set 1992 as a target for creating a genuine
internal market in industrial products and services.
    Delors said the people had to be convinced that increasing
group resources did not necessarily mean raising their taxes.

<TITLE>U.S. CONCERNED ABOUT INCREASED JAPAN VOTES AT ADB</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OSAKA, Japan, April 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Washington views with concern a
plan to increase Japan's voting power at the Asian Development
Bank (ADB), a U.S. Delegate at the bank's annual meeting said.
    Japan, which holds 15.1 pct of the ADB's capital stock, and
the U.S. Which holds 14.9 pct, currently have near-parity in
voting power.
    "The ADB was set up in 1966 as a partnership between the
U.S. And Japan," the official said. "Any change in that
relationship would transmit a psychological message to this
region's countries that there is a slackening of interest on
the part of the U.S."
    "We do not want any dilution of our influence in the
organisation," the U.S. Official added.
    He said an imbalance in procurement contracts awarded for
ADB-funded projects was however improving slowly.
    The U.S. Share of the contracts had grown from about seven
pct to about 12 pct in 1986, the official said, while Japan's
share had dropped from 25 pct to 20 pct.
    "We will urge more U.S. Businessmen to join in the bidding
for these projects," he said.
    The official said Washington was concerned about the ADB's
future role in the region.
    "The U.S. Believes the ADB should act as a catalyst both for
policy changes that will lead to sustainable, long-term
economic growth and for other financial flows," chief U.S.
Delegate Charles Dallara told the meeting earlier.
    "Economic reform should be a theme of the ADB's lending," the
unidentified U.S. Official said.
    "The bank is doing its borrowers a disservice by not
entering into policy dialogue," he added.
    "We are looking for the bank to take up the cudgel when its
borrowers are at a critical stage in their development. We are
looking at a 15 or 20 year horizon."

<TITLE>BANKS SEE GERMAN GROWTH OF AT LEAST TWO PCT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>External risks for the economy have
increased, but growth of two to 2.5 pct this year is still
possible, according to President of the West German Federation
of Banks, Hanns Christian Schroeder-Hohenwarth.
    Schroeder-Hohenwarth told a news conference the further
fall of the dollar since the start of this year and the
revaluation of the mark against European currencies meant West
German exporters were facing a "rough wind."
    However, domestic demand was continuing to rise and private
consumption in particular would support the economy, he said.
He saw good prospects for consumer industries.
    Schroeder-Hohenwarth said economic policy now had to
concentrate on strengthening this domestic growth. In this
context, he welcomed a decision by the government to increase
the scope of tax cuts due in 1988.
    He added, a planned reform of the fiscal system scheduled
for 1990, which was worked out by coalition partners this
month, was an "important step in the right direction."
    The government plans to cut corporation tax to 50 pct from
56 pct. However, Schroeder-Hohenwarth said the decision to cut
the maximum rate of income tax to only 53 pct from 56 pct was
"rather half-hearted."

<TITLE>SAUDI ARABIA LIBERALISES BANKING SYSTEM</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Stephen Jukes, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BAHRAIN, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Saudi Arabia has speeded up reform of
its financial system with a package of measures designed to
boost the economy and open up the Kingdom to the lucrative
world of investment banking.
    Bankers in Saudi Arabia detect a fundamental shift in
policy stemming from a need to tackle the underlying
contradiction between an Islamic legal framework and western
banking system.
    One senior banker in Jeddah said: "There is a new wind
blowing... Saudi Arabia is moving on many fronts in a manner
that is extraordinarily aggressive."
    The speed of reform, begun last year but now gathering
pace, has surprised bankers who have had to contend with a
financial system that restricted internationalisation of the
riyal and a religious court system that made debt collecting
difficult.
    Saudi banks, once the most profitable in the world, have
generally reported falling profits for 1986 -- the fourth
successive year of decline -- as loan loss provisions ate into
already dwindling earnings.
    Bankers say the Saudi Finance Ministry and Saudi Arabian
Monetary Agency (SAMA) seem to have developed a new strategy
although it remains to be seen how it will be implemented.
    Reform started in 1986 with measures to boost previously
dormant stock trading, but took off in earnest this year.
    -- From January 1, SAMA liberalised the money market,
giving banks greater access to liquidity aid via repurchase
agreements.
    -- From March 22, the Finance Ministry abolished
withholding tax on funds borrowed by Saudi banks abroad.
    -- From the same date, banks were notified of a new
committee to be set up under the auspices of SAMA to hear bank
disputes with creditors over non-payment of loans.
    -- Also from the same date, banks were allowed to use
mortgages as collateral for lending, banned since 1981.
    -- Within a few weeks, the Kingdom's first stock market
trading floor is expected to be opened.
    Housed in central Riyadh in the building of the Saudi
Industrial Development Fund, the floor will initially be used
to trade shares on an auction system. Staff from each of the 11
commercial banks have been trained ahead of the launch and a
new computer network has been set up.
    One banker said: "The abolition of withholding tax will give
banks the opportunity to participate in new instruments such as
interest rate or currency swaps. At last SAMA and the Finance
Ministry are opening up markets for investment banking."
    Bankers say Saudi authorities appear to have been shocked
into reform by pressure from banks and alarm at bank reluctance
to extend further loans to the private sector.
    Banks have lobbied hard for change, arguing that the
religious, or Sharia, legal framework was inconsistent with the
Kingdom's western banking system and made it nigh impossible
for them to collect interest on bad loans through the courts.
    As a result, many banks had virtually stopped new lending,
but found themselves cut off from world investment banking by a
series of restrictions. Withholding tax made it punitively
expensive to take part in interest rate or currency swaps.
    The private sector's frustration at the virtual standstill
in bank lending overflowed at a businessmen's conference in the
mountain resort in Abha last month and some powerful merchant
families also called for change, bankers said.
    "Banks lobbied hard and had the ultimate weapon to force
change -- they stopped lending," another banker said. "That was
stifling growth of the economy."
    It is still unclear whether the new committee that will be
set up to hear bank disputes with creditors will prove any more
efficient than another non-Sharia system already in force, the
Committees for the Settlement of Commercial Disputes (CSCDs).
    Some bankers believe the new committee, yet to be formed,
will simply delay pending cases and force banks into a series
of private deals with creditors.
    Nor is it clear what stance the new committee will take on
interest payments, generally not recognised under Islamic law.
    But other bankers say the move is clear recognition by SAMA
and the Finance Ministry that Sharia courts and the CSCDs were
not the correct bodies for hearing bank disputes.
    Other reforms have been taken or are in the pipeline.
Finance Minister Mohammed Ali Abal-Khail said in March that a
new body would examine late government payments to contractors.
    In addition, further moves are under way to align business
life to the Gregorian calendar year, with companies being urged
to adopt it as their financial year.
    A black list of borrowers, started more than two years ago
by banks, has recently been effectively sanctioned by SAMA,
bankers say.
    Banks are now not permitted to lend or engage in securities
transactions with any party on the list.

<TITLE>INDONESIAN FOREIGN DEBTS MANAGEABLE, CONABLE SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesia's foreign debts are a cause
for concern, but remain within manageable limits, World Bank
President Barber Conable said.
    He told a press conference before leaving for Tokyo that
Indonesia's rising debt-service ratio was a problem and cause
for concern. But he said it was not necessarily due to
imprudent borrowing and "it is still within an area of being
manageable."
    The bank estimates Indonesia has total foreign debts of
around 37 billion dlrs. The debt service ratio has risen to a
projected 33 pct for fiscal 1987/88, from 25 pct in 1986/87
ending March 31.
    Anything above 20 pct is considered high by bankers.
    Conable said the decline in world oil prices and the rise
in the value of the Japanese yen had increased the ratio by
reducing Indonesian exports and raising its debt repayments.
    Indonesian debt servicing of 6,760 billion rupiah takes up
almost one third of the 1987/88 budget.
    Payment on the principal of government debts is officially
projected at 2.73 billion dlrs in 1987/88 against 2.11 billion
in 1986/87.
    Conable linked an increase in World Bank lending to
Indonesia to implementation of further economic policy reforms.

<TITLE>HIGHER REVENUES DEAL BLOW TO JAPAN TAX REFORM PLAN</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rich Miller, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's
diminishing hopes of overhauling the tax system have been dealt
a serious blow by reports of sharply higher than expected tax
revenues in 1986/87, government officials said.
    Nakasone has argued that the tax system must be reformed to
provide the revenue for more than 1,000 billion yen of tax cuts
promised in the government's emergency economic package last
month. But his argument has been undercut by reports that the
1986/87 tax take was as much as 2,500 billion yen more than
expected.
    That means the government should have more than enough
money in the fiscal year ending next March to pay for the
planned tax cuts without having recourse to the unpopular tax
measures proposed by Nakasone, one official said.
    The Prime Minister has proposed an indirect tax and the
abolition of tax breaks on small savings as ways of raising
revenue to offset the tax cuts.
    But stiff opposition has forced him to shelve the idea of
an indirect tax, at least for the time being. He still hopes to
gain parliamentary approval next month to abolish tax breaks on
small savings.
    The higher than expected revenues in 1986/87 partly stemmed
from increased receipts from land and securities taxes, as
prices of both shares and land soared, one official said.
    But corporate tax revenues have also been more buoyant than
expected, perhaps indicating the recession of the last year
induced by the strong yen was not as bad as thought, he said.
    The final figures for 1986/87 revenues are due to be
released by the Finance Ministry on July 1.
    The higher revenues last fiscal year have also undercut
attempts by the Finance Ministry's budget bureau to reduce
investment spending by government departments in the 1988/89
budget, several officials said.
    A budget bureau official said the bureau still wanted to
stick with its so-called "minus-ceiling" policy, which calls for
government departments to reduce investment spending by five
pct a year.
    But he acknowledged this would be difficult, given the
sharp increase in revenues last fiscal year and heavy domestic
and U.S. Pressure on the ministry to stimulate the economy.

<TITLE>IMF OFFICIAL RESIGNS CHARGING U.S. LOAN PRESSURE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Alver Carlson, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>One of the top executives of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) has tendered his resignation
charging that the United States has been pressuring the agency
to reduce the conditions it places on some loans, monetary
sources said.
    C. David Finch, an Australian who heads the IMF's exchange
and trade relations department, told the IMF executive board on
Wednesday that he planned to leave by the end of next month
after 37 years with the agency.
    The sources said that Finch, in a statement considered
unprecedented, told the board that the United States had
brought undue pressure on the IMF to approve funding for Zaire
and Egypt.
    "To resign in this manner is highly unusual, perhaps
unprecedented," a monetary source said.
    Neither Finch nor U.S. IMF Representative Charles Dallara
could be reached for comment.
    The IMF, since the emergence of the debt crisis in 1982,
has pressed many countries to tighten their belts and cut back
on social spending as conditions to granting assistance.
    The United States recently has been taking the position
that countries that take needed economic reform measures
relying more on market forces and private enterprise should be
encouraged by assistance from the IMF and development banks.
    Zaire, under the government of President Mobutu Sese Seko
has recently been taking many reform measures designed to heal
its ailing economy.
    The IMF last year approved a 22-month loan package for
Zaire totaling 270 mln dlrs.
    The United States has been considering the possibility of
seeking access to a military base in Zaire but no decision has
been reached.
    Egypt, for its part, has been holding talks with the IMF
aimed at reaching a final accord on a new one billion dlr loan
package with the United States pressing for a quick deal,
according to the sources.
    However, they said a tentative plan for Egypt that is
currently being reviewed by the management of the Fund prior to
going to the executive board for full approval has raised a
number of questions about the country's ability to repay.
    Egypt is also a linchpin in the broad framework of U.S.
Middle East policy.
    The department headed by Finch, among other
responsibilties, makes certain that IMF policies and loan
conditions are wielded evenly among countries.
    Monetary sources have said that the United States had
brought pressure on the IMF to approve a loan package for
Mexico using economic conditions that have not been broadly
used before, but Finch, according to the sources, made no
reference to this.
    Under the debt initiative announced 18 months ago by
Treasury Secretary James Baker, the United States made the
decision that debtor countries should be encourged to grow out
of their difficulties rather than rely on austerity measures.
     He also recommended that commercial banks provide 20
billion dlrs in new loans for the debtor countries while the
mutilateral banks add some six billion dlrs over three years.
    A key part of the proposal gave the World Bank a much
greater role in dealing with the debt crisis, in part because
of its familiarity with developing countries and their
problems.
    The initiative, while widely heralded as a good first step
toward improving the the growing debt crisis, was viewed by
some at the IMF as a rebuke of previous austerity measures
insisted upon by the Fund in return for loans.

<TITLE>NAKASONE HARD-PRESSED TO SOOTHE U.S ANGER ON TRADE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rich Miller, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 27 - </DATELINE><BODY>Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will
visit Washington next month in a bid to defuse mounting U.S.
Anger over Japanese trade policies, but Western diplomats said
they believed his chances of success were slim.
    Boxed in by powerful political pressure groups and
widespread opposition to his tax reform plans, Nakasone will be
hard-pressed to come up with anything new to tell U.S.
President Ronald Reagan and key U.S. Congressmen, they said.
    News of the week-long visit starting April 29 coincided
with news that Japan recorded a 8.14 billion dlr trade surplus
last month, more than 70 pct higher than a year earlier.
    It also came one day after the Reagan Administration's
Economic Policy Council decided to take retaliatory action
against Japan for its alleged failure to live up to a joint
trade agreement on computer microchips.
    Nakasone wants to go armed with two separate packages - one
designed to pep up Japan's sagging economy and imports in the
short-term, the other to redirect the country in the medium
term away from its over-dependence on exports for growth.
    But government officials said political infighting could
rob both packages of much of their punch and might even prevent
one from seeing the light of day.
    Nakasone has insisted that the government would not draw up
a package of short-term economic measures until after its
1987/88 budget passed parliament because he feared that would
amount to a tacit admission that the budget was inadequate.
    But his hopes for quick passage of the budget in time for
his trip have been shattered by a parliamentary boycott by
opposition parties protesting over the sales tax plan.
    Faced with the possibility that he might have to go to the
U.S. Virtually empty-handed, Nakasone today ordered his ruling
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to come up with its own
measures.
    He can then tell Reagan the LDP package will form the basis
of the government's plans, without losing face in parliament
over the budget, political analysts said.
    Officials working on the government's short-term economic
package said it would probably include interest rate cuts on
loans by government corporations, deregulation, measures to
pass on some of the benefits of the strong yen to consumers in
the form of lower prices, and accelerated public investment.
    They said a record portion of state investment planned for
the entire 1987/88 fiscal year will take place in the first
half, probably over 80 pct.
    Diplomats said that was unlikely to be enough to satisfy
Reagan, who is under pressure from the Democrat-controlled U.S.
Congress to take greater action to cut the huge American trade
deficit.
    To complement the short-term measures, Nakasone is also
likely to present Reagan with details of Japan's longer-term
economic plans.
    A high-ranking advisory body headed by former Bank of Japan
governor Haruo Maekawa is expected to come up with a final
report outlining concrete steps to redirect the economy days
before Nakasone is scheduled to leave for Washington.
    Its recommendations are designed as a follow-up to
Maekawa's report last year on economic restructuring and are
likely to cover such potentially politically explosive areas as
agricultural reform and land policy, officials said.
    While wanting to make the report as explicit and detailed
as possible, they said the political realities might force them
to water down some of the committee's recommendations.
    A subcommittee is considering what the Japanese economy
might look like in the medium to longer term after it undergoes
massive restructuring, officials said. The subcommittee
projects that the current account surplus will fall to less
than two pct of Japan's total output, or gross national
product, around 1993 or 1995. Last year the surplus, which
measures trade in goods and services, amounted to over four pct
of gnp.
    The subcommittee also projects annual economic growth for
Japan of nearly four pct over that period and a very gradual
appreciation of the yen, to about 130 to the dollar by around
1993, from 150 now.

<TITLE>ZAMBIAN CENTRAL BANKER CRITICISES IMF POLICIES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUSAKA, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bank of Zambia general manager Michael
Mwape has accused the International Monetary Fund of ignoring
social conditions when drawing up its economic reform
programmes for African countries.
    Mwape said in a speech to businessmen in the southern town
of Livingstone yesterday that the IMF's approach had caused
social and political unrest across the continent.
    There was widespread rioting and looting in Zambia last
December after the government abolished subsidies on refined
maize meal in line with IMF recommendations.
    Mwape said told businessmen "The question which should be
asked and answered when designing programmes is who is going to
bear the brunt of adjustment ... And what cushion is available
to minimise the burden ?"
    Zambia has had five IMF adjustment programmes since 1976,
the last of which was cancelled in February last year, he said.
"In spite of these, the economy has shown signs of stress, with
no significant improvement in a number of areas," he added.
    Zambia has just completed a new round of IMF talks on its
foreign exchange system and has obtained enough commercial
loans to pay off its IMF arrears for 1985 and 1986, paving the
way for a new stand-by credit.
    Zambian politicians have frequently criticised the fund,
however, and diplomats say President Kenneth Kaunda faces
consistent opposition inside the ruling party's central
committee over dealings with the IMF.

<TITLE>GERMANY PLANS TO RUSH SPECIAL CREDITS TO FARMERS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Felix Dearden, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BONN, June 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bonn is expected to rush through
legislation this month creating special credits to protect West
German farmers from a proposed European Community, EC, payments
freeze, government sources said.
    The new measures are apparently designed to shield West
German farmers from the consequences of the looming EC budget
crisis and give Bonn scope to keep up its opposition to the EC
executive commission's farm policy reform plans, political
sources said.
    EC finance and farm minsters held an unprecedented joint
session in Luxembourg today to try to solve the stalemate over
future farm financing.
    West Germany has proved the main obstacle to Commission
attempts to raise fresh funds for farm financing by taxing
imports of vegetable oil and fats, for fear of U.S.
retaliation.
    Bonn has also opposed the abolition of an agri-monetary
mechanism that acts as a subsidy for West German farm exports.
    The draft legislation, which the ruling centre-right
coalition will present to parliament tomorrow, would provide
temporary credits for farm subsidies usually paid by Brussels.
    The Commission, facing a five billion European Currency
Units (5.73 billion dlrs) budget deficit by the end of the
year, has threatened to start phasing out payment of some
subsidies and premiums from August, unless EC member states
take urgent measures to provide fresh funds.
    West German Agriculture Minister Ignaz Kiechle gave the new
legislation top priority after last month's failure to agree to
a farm price package for 1986/87.
    Political sources in Bonn said Kiechle decided to take the
sting out of proposed Commission measures to cut back subsidies
by creating a buffer for West German farmers.
    The opposition SPD has agreed to back the Kiechle bill and
allow its hasty passage through parliament by July 1, ahead of
the summer recess, SPD sources said.
    SPD farm policy spokesman Jan Oostergetelo said his party
would support the bill, even though it would further swell
massive government spending on agriculture. He said the bill
was an admission that the government believes the farm price
talks will fail and the EC faces bankruptcy.
    According to a copy of the draft bill obtained by Reuters,
government authorities will have over two billion marks (1.1
billion dlrs) available to pay farmers advance subsidies and
premiums for grains and other crops harvested this summer.
    The Commission has agreed to pay the subsidies eventually.
But paying farmers on time will cost Bonn about 100 mln marks
(55 mln dlrs) in interest payments, farm policy sources said.
    Chancellor Helmut Kohl's cabinet is expected to support the
bill when it meets tomorrow.

<AUTHOR>    By Kunio Inoue, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>The ruling Liberal Democratic Party's
(LDP) setback in Sunday's nationwide local elections may force
the government to water down its controversial proposal for a
five pct sales tax and undermine its commitment to stimulating
the economy, private economists said.
    The LDP's failure to win seats in some crucial local
constituencies will weaken the government's ability to push
through its tax plan, and without a compromise tax proposal the
budget for fiscal 1987/88 ending March 31 is unlikely to be
passed soon, they said.
    Without the budget, the government would also be
hard-pressed to come up with an effective package to stimulate
the economy as pledged at Group of Seven meetings in Paris in
late February and in Washington last week, they said.
    Opposition protests against the sales tax have stalled
parliamentary debate on the budget for weeks and forced the
government to enact a stop-gap 1987/88 budget that began early
this month.
    "The LDP's election setback will have an enormous impact on
the already faltering economy," said Johsen Takahashi, chief
economist at Mitsubishi Research Institute.
    Takahashi said that behind the LDP's poor showing was
public discontent with the government's high-handed push for
tax reform and its lack of effective policies to cope with
economic woes caused by the yen's appreciation.
    "This explains why the LDP failed to regain governorships in
the most hotly contested constituencies of Fukuoka and
Hokkaido, where the shipbuilding and steel industries are
suffering heavily from the yen's extended rise," he said.
    Takahashi said the government should delay introduction of
the sales tax for one or two years beyond its original starting
date of January 1988 and implement tax cuts now.
    Sumitomo Bank Ltd chief economist Masahiko Koido also said
he favours watering down the proposed sales tax while
suggesting the government boost public works spending by
modifying its tight fiscal policies.
    "The local election results were a signal the economy now
needs government action to take clear-cut fiscal measures," he
said, adding that such moves would help the world economy as
well as Japan's.
    For the last five years or so, the government has stuck to
a tight fiscal policy in a bid to halt the issue of deficit
financing bonds by fiscal 1990/91, economists said.
    If the LDP election setback leads to a scaled down sales
tax proposal, the government would have to find other revenue
sources to help finance the planned tax cuts and a package of
measures to stimulate the economy, the economists said.
    Koido said the government could raise additional revenue by
selling shares in public corporations such as Nippon Telegraph
and Telephone Corp. But it should issue additional bonds to
ensure a more stable source of funds, he said.
    "It may run counter to its avowed policy of balancing the
budget, but it can do so on a short-term basis," he said.
    Takahashi of Mitsubishi Research also agreed with the need
for the government to float more bonds to raise funds needed
for economic expansion.
    He said additional government borrowing would place no
burden on the capital market because it has amassed huge excess
funds and government bond prices have risen to record levels
lately.
    "The market is just waiting for more new government bond
issues," he said.

<TITLE>N.Z. GOVERNMENT POPULARITY RISES AHEAD OF ELECTION</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Christopher Pritchett, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>New Zealand's ruling Labour Party
government has just completed its three-year economic reform
which threw thousands of people out of work, yet its popularity
has risen as the September deadline for the election draws
closer, a recent poll shows.
    An Eyewitness/Heylen Poll, conducted for Television New
Zealand's Eyewitness news broadcast on April 2, showed Labour
had the support of 50 pct of voters compared with the
opposition National Party's 46 pct.
    The figures had been reversed in a poll a month earlier.
    The poll showed 40 pct of the canvassed voters thought the
economy would improve over the next year, up 12 points on last
month's result.
    The increase came in a week when the government turned
seven departments into nine profit-oriented corporations run by
businessmen who promptly sacked some 4,000 employees, including
half the country's 1,700 coal miners.
    The latest survey confounded those who proclaimed Labour's
days were numbered because of perceived insensitivity to its
traditional backers, the workers, political analysts said.
    The poll indicates people are swinging behind the party and
the arguments of Finance Minister Roger Douglas, who has
presided over the deregulation of the economy and the
construction of one based on market forces without subsidies or
currency controls, the analysts said.
    The economic reforms, by a party increasingly regarded in
New Zealand as more akin to the West European-style Social
Democrats than working class socialists, have rattled the
National Party, which is now regretting it was not as
innovative in the decade it ruled until Prime Minister Robert
Muldoon was ousted in 1983, one analyst said.
    The National Party was further shaken, the analyst said,
when the Press, a Christchurch daily, said on April 2 the party
was "on the verge of flying apart" with the prospect of a coup
attempt against leader Jim Bolger by Muldoon. Bolger said the
article was an April Fool's joke.
    Labour's reforms have brought unexpectedly strong tax
revenues, a lower budget deficit and less state borrowing, an
improvement in the balance of payments, a reduction in foreign
debt and improved productivity, economists said.
    Inflation should peak at 19.5 pct in the quarter ended
March 31 and fall to about eight pct within a year, they said.
    Labour's reforms have hit every sector, but the most
dramatic was the "corporatisation" of seven government
departments on April 1, which critics argue is the first stage
step towards the sale of state assets, the analysts said.
    The move stops short of privatisation, as the state will
retain ownership, but the new corporations are expected to be
financially self-supporting and pay dividends.
    Arguments have already broken out over money. One utility,
Electricorp, said its assets are worth less than 3.8 billion
dlrs yet the Treasury wants 8.5 billion for them.
    No agreement has been reached on the value of assets of the
former forest service, the analysts added.
    Chairman Alan Gibbs said in a speech the forest service had
been losing 100 mln dlrs annually, yet due to economies it now
employed less than 30 pct of its previous workforce and the new
corporation would pay the state a dividend of at least 20 mln
dlrs in its first year.
    Uncertainties have also arisen over the government, as the
only shareholder, retaining the right to order the new
corporations to undertake certain projects although the full
cost must be met by the state, the analysts said.
    Deputy prime minister Geoffrey Palmer said managers would
be held accountable for performance, with the government paying
for projects undertaken for social or environmental reasons.
    This policy has already caused problems, the analysts
added. For example, Electricorp has refused to spend several
hundred million dlrs to build a hydro project at Luggate,
further up the Clutha river from the Clyde high dam now under
construction in Central Otago.
    Prime Minister David Lange said this week that Labour MPs
had decided last year that Luggate be built and it was
important that the government honour its promises.
    "But it is also a matter of importance that we do not see
many more jobs lost because of economic distortion than we
would save by having that promise honoured to the last," he
added.

<TITLE>EC MINISTERS STRUGGLE TO AGREE ON DAIRY CUTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>European Community, EC, agriculture
ministers struggled today to finalise new rules aimed at
limiting sales into public cold stores of unwanted butter at
high guaranteed EC prices, diplomats said.
    The plan is the key element in a landmark accord to cut
dairy output by 9.5 pct over two years agreed in outline last
December after virtually nine days of non-stop negotiations.
    The accord, which is due to operate from the start of the
new milk marketing year on April 1, was hailed as the most
significant step in an on-going campaign to reform costly EC
farm policies and cut embarrassing food surpluses.
    Diplomats say the December agreement itself is not
threatened but that its effect could be considerably weakened
if the proposals are altered too radically.
    West Germany and Ireland are opposed to proposed limits on
a farmer's now automatic right to sell surplus butter into
public stores when market prices and stocks are high.
    Faced with a butter "mountain" of a record 1.2 mln tonnes
costing over two mln dlrs per day just to store, EC farm
Commissioner Frans Andriessen says farmers must be encouraged
to cut production to meet demand.
    He is keen to reach an agreement on the milk problem before
the ministers move on to consider this year's annual price
review which proposes extending the new system for butter sales
to other sectors such as cereals.

<TITLE>WORLD BANK SUGGESTS MORE OPEN ECONOMY FOR INDIA</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Ajoy Sen, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW DELHI, April 21 - </DATELINE><BODY>The World Bank has suggested India
should move to a more open economy by gradually removing most
government controls on industry and adopting a liberal external
trade policy with reduced levels of protection.
    A confidential "executive summary" of a draft Bank report on
the Indian economy was made available to Reuters. It suggests
liberalisation as part of a package of reforms to boost exports
of Indian goods by making them more competitive.
    The summary said, "These reforms would result in (domestic)
prices much more in line with world prices than is true today,
and in a greater degree of import competition and export
rivalry than the nation has ever seen."
    The summary said foreign trade must play a key role in
India's transition towards a more dynamic economy. Liberal
imports of capital goods would help modernise the economy and
expose Indian producers to foreign competition. Larger exports
would provide the foreign exchange for imports.
    "The main guideline is unambiguously to abandon the present
principle of unlimited protection for all indigenously
available products and to recognise the role of actual or
potential competition from imports as a source of discipline on
the prices and costs of public and private sector domestic
manufacturers," the summary said.
    An Indian official told Reuters the government was
discussing the report with the Bank. A final report with some
changes was likely to be ready by May, but he declined to give
further details.
    The Bank and industrialised nations will discuss the Bank's
final report at a meeting in Paris on June 22 and 23 to discuss
aid for India in the 1987/88 year starting in June.
    The summary said India's gross domestic product (gdp) grew
at an average five pct in Indian fiscal years 1985/86 and
1986/87, which ended in March.
    It said investment was being sustained at nearly 25 pct of
gdp. Almost 94 pct of the investment was being financed by
national savings, mainly from the private sector.
    India's trade deficit is officially said to have narrowed
to 5.6 billion dlrs in 1986/87 ended March, from a record 6.96
billion dlrs in 1985/86. The current account deficit fell to
2.4 billion dlrs in 1986/87 from 2.88 billion in 1985/86.
    But the summary said the improvement was largely due to
lower prices of crude oil, petroleum products and fertilisers
which make up the bulk of India's import bill.
    India was able to save about 2.6 billion dlrs in foreign
exchange in 1986/87 due to lower prices of those products, the
summary said.
    The Bank's summary said there was little room for
complacency in the balance of payments position.
    It said that despite a lower trade deficit in 1986/87,
Indian foreign exchange reserves fell by 240 mln dlrs.
    Real export growth would need to average at least 6.1 pct a
year in value terms in the coming years to maintain a viable
balance of payments, the summary said.
    It did not explicitly suggest the rupee should be devalued.
India "might have to reaffirm the commitment to exporting while
undertaking some dramatic changes in general incentives that
involve some political costs," it said.
    "An example of such a policy would be the adoption of an
exchange rate regime that maintained exporters' profitability,"
the summary said.
    It said such an approach had been successful in countries
such as South Korea, Colombia and Turkey. It would maintain the
competitiveness of Indian exports and simultaneously reduce
import pressures.
    Earlier this year, the Indian government denied that the
World Bank asked it to devalue the Indian rupee to boost
exports.

<TITLE>JAPAN RULING PARTY PREPARES FINAL ECONOMIC PACKAGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP) drew up a final plan to expand domestic demand and boost
imports in time for Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's visit to
Washington next week, LDP officials said.
    The plan calls for additional fiscal measures worth more
than 5,000 billion yen, a large-scale supplementary budget for
the current fiscal year started April 1, and concentration of
more than 80 pct of the annual public works budget in the first
half of the year, they said.
    Nakasone will explain the measures to U.S. Officials during
his visit to Washington starting April 29.

    The LDP plan will be the basis for a government package of
pump-priming measures expected to be unveiled in late May.
    The LDP said Japan should do more to reduce its trade
surplus. Its plan is expected to help increase economic growth
led by domestic demand, officials said.
    The government was also urged to review the ceiling on
budgetary requests for investment purposes in 1988/89. The
government has imposed a five pct cut in investment outlays in
the past five years in line with Nakasone's avowed policy of
fiscal reforms.

    The plan called on Japan to promote government purchases of
foreign goods and private sector imports of manufactured goods
by improving import financing, and to make clear official
procurement procedures for foreign supercomputers.
    The LDP also said Japan should contribute further to
society at large through measures such as doubling its official
development assistance to 7.6 billion dlrs in five years or so
instead of seven years as the government had originally
promised.
    The government was urged to work out a program to recycle
funds from Japan's trade surpluses to debt-ridden countries.

    The officials said the funds to be recycled would include
those from the private sector and others provided through the
government Export-Import Bank of Japan and Japan's Overseas
Economic Cooperation Fund.
    The plan also calls for the government to take steps to
help the development of African and other less developed
nations.
    The LDP called for adequate and flexible management of
monetary policy, such as a cut in interest rates on deposits
with the Finance Ministry's Trust Fund, and a tax cut to
promote plant and equipment investment.

<TITLE>CONSERVATIVE GAINS MAY SPEED FINNISH MARKET REFORM</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Simon Haydon, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    HELSINKI, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Conservative gains in Finnish general
elections could speed liberalisation of financial markets,
though there will not be a radical economic restructuring,
conservative officials and economic analysts said.
    The conservatives gained nine new seats in parliament after
the two-day elections, which ended yesterday, and political
commentators say social democrat Prime Minister Kalevi Sorsa is
likely to be replaced by a centre-right coalition.
    International spokesman Pasi Natri told Reuters: "we are
willing to liberalise the economy as much as possible."
    Helsinki analysts said the outgoing centre-left coalition
had introduced major reforms of money and stock markets in its
period of government between 1983 and 1987.
    They said Finnish conservatives bore little resemblance to
other European conservative movements and had, for example,
shelved privatisation policies to increase their popularity.
    Finnish trade affairs are dominated by its special ties
with its neighbour, The Soviet Union, and a new centre-right
coalition could alter this relationship, the analysts said.
   The two countries have a long-term pact under which trade
must be balanced in value. The 1987 accord signed in January
agreed bilateral trade totalling about 30 billion markka.
    Finland exports finished products to the USSR, with crude
oil accounting for 80 pct of imports.
    The Centre Party said before the elections that Fenno-
Soviet trade would have to be cut because Finland had to trim
exports when the value of Moscow's oil exports to Finland fell.
    Finnish financial markets reacted cautiously to the
election news, with little movement in the markka or on the
Helsinki stock exchange.
    Securities analysts said the market would respond positively
if a centre-right coalition was formed, but added it was too
early to exclude the possibility that social democrats would
hang on to power.
    The spokesman said conservatives favoured legislation
governing the stock market to prevent "casino-style behaviour."
    He said the conservatives also favoured the establishment
of an internal market between the Nordic countries.
     International capital markets were becoming more and more
important, he  said, adding conservatives would speed up the
development of Finland's capial markets.
   He said the conservatives supported the bilateral trade ties
with Moscow, but that links with western Europe should be
studied. Finland is a member of the European Free Trade
Association ( EFTA).
    Negotiations between the major Finnish political parties
are likely to be protracted, and the shape of the new
government will probably not be established before the start of
April.
    Conservatives hold 44 seats now, The Centre Party gained
three to 40 and the social democrats lost one, and now hold 56
seats.

<TITLE>FURTHER WEAKNESS SEEN IN TOKYO STOCKS IN NEAR TERM</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By James Kynge, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Tokyo share prices are expected to weaken
further for about a week, following a sharp drop which at one
time today saw the Nikkei Dow index down 571.01 points in
mid-afternoon trading, brokers said.
    They said uncertainty caused by disputes between Japan and
its main trading partners will continue to deter investors from
equities.
    The market index, which closed the day 297.05 points down
at 22,919.54, will probably end the present downturn at around
22,300 points, brokers predicted.
    "This is just a short-term correction and the market will
probably end up at about 22,300 in about a week's time," said a
broker at Nomura Securities Co.
    He said that today's late recovery from afternoon lows
showed that investors were still hunting bargains in
anticipation of an upturn.
    Brokers reiterated expectations of an imminent cut in
Japan's 2.5 pct discount rate, a factor seen to be diverting
money from bank accounts into stocks and boosting the market.
    Securities company, bank and insurance issues, likely to
benefit from a rate cut, were bought in late trading.
    The Nomura broker said he expects the rate cut in May or
June, after Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's scheduled visit
to Washington on April 29. Nakasone is expected to seek an end
to Japanese-U.S. Trade disputes which are hurting investor
confidence.
    "Until we see some concerted effort by the Japanese to halt
the yen's rise against the dollar and settle trade disputes,
the market will stay low," said head of equities at Jardine
Fleming Securities Co, Mario Malt.
    Malt said current talks between the countries were
inflammatory and damaged stockmarket optimism.
    Brokers also said that Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic
Party has to show it still rules, after Sunday's nationwide
local elections showed dwindling support.
    "It raises doubts on whether the LDP can push through the
reforms it planned for this year," said one broker.
    Top policy priorities this year are deregulation of
financial activities, stimulation of domestic demand to boost
imports and removal of agricultural subsidies.
    If these policies are abandoned or scaled down, stockmarket
investors will have few reasons to buy stocks, brokers said.

<TITLE>ADMINISTRATION SAYS INSURANCE CRISIS EASED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Reagan administration said the
national crisis in liability insurance eased during the past
year as the insurance industry's profits more than doubled to
11.5 billion dlrs, but some problems still persist.
    An administration working group, in an update of its report
a year ago, found that insurance premiums generally have
stabilized, but at high levels, as the crisis has abated.
    After severe financial difficulties in 1984 and 1985, the
insurance industry's rate of return last year recovered to the
same level as the performace of U.S. corporations in general,
the group said in a 98-page study.
    While the crisis has eased, the study found that liability
insurance will likely remain expensive and continue to be
difficult to obtain for some lines of coverage and for some
sectors of the American economy.
    Some types of insurance, especially associated with
environmental liability, remain unavailable for many companies
at any price, it said.
    The increased availability and the price stability for
insurance the past year has been accompanied by higher
deductibles, lower coverage limits and additional policy
restrictions, the study said.
    The administration last year unveiled a wide range of
recommendations aimed at dealing with the crisis, including 
limits on punitive damages and awards for pain, suffering and
mental anguish at 100,000 dlrs.
    Attorney General Edwin Meese told a news conference today
that the administration still supports state efforts to place
limits on damage awards and to enact other reforms of the tort
laws.
    Assistant Attorney General Richard Willard denied charges
by consumer groups that the insurance crisis was caused by
industry collusion to raise rates in violation of the antitrust
laws. Willard, the head of the working group, said excessive
jury damage awards was the main reason for the insurance
liability problem.

<TITLE>EC FARM CRISIS LIKELY TO GO TO END-JUNE SUMMIT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Gerrard Raven, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LUXEMBOURG, June 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>Plans for key reforms of the European
Community's (EC) controversial farm policy will almost
certainly have to be referred to the bloc's heads of government
at a summit meeting on June 29 and 30, Belgian finance minister
Mark Eyskens said today.
    Eyskens was speaking at a news conference after chairing a
joint meeting of EC finance and agriculture ministers which was
designed to help break a deadlock over this year's EC farm
price package which has endured since March.
    Diplomats quoted EC Executive Commission president Jacques
Delors as saying at the same meeting that it would be a
disaster if the two most difficult issues at the farm talks had
to be referred to heads of government.
    These issues are a Commission plan for a tax on marine and
vegetable fats and oils, and proposals to change the system by
which EC farm prices, expressed in European currency units
(Ecus), are translated into the currencies of member states.
    The oils and fats tax is opposed by a group of countries
which fears it could provoke trade retaliation by the U.S., A
major exporter of soybeans to the EC.
    West Germany, meanwhile, is strongly against the technical
currency move, which would result in additional price cuts for
farmers in countries with strong currencies, such as the mark.
    Commission sources said Delors is anxious that the two
issues are not referred to the summit because this would mean
heads of government diverting their attention from much more
important world and Community issues.
    Eyskens said decisions from heads of government were also
likely to be less sound since they do not usually interest
themselves in such technically complex questions.
    However, Eyskens said today's meeting had thrown up some
nuances in member state positions "which may make the dialogue
more constructive in the next few weeks."
    If farm prices are not decided by the end of this month,
the Commission could use its own powers to impose a seven pct
cut in cereals prices, farm trade sources said. It originally
proposed measures to cut farm spending by 1.1 billion Ecus this
year, with effective price cuts of over 10 pct for some crops.
    Diplomats said farm ministers might be able to agree a
price package cutting spending by around 340 mln Ecus but for
their disagreements on the oils/fats tax and on currency
reforms.
    The finance ministers were called in to emphasise the need
for budgetary restraint in the face of an almost certain EC
budget deficit of over five billion Ecus this year.
    Although Delors was said by aides to have found today's
meeting very useful, diplomats said there was little sign of a
major shift in the position of member states, or of finance
ministers adopting a different line from that of their
agriculture colleagues.
    The farm ministers are expected to meet for most of this
week in Luxembourg in a pre-summit attempt to bridge their
differences.

<TITLE>YUGOSLAVIA SEEKS TWO BILLION DLR REFINANCING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BELGRADE, March 23 - </DATELINE><BODY>Deputy Prime Minister Janez Zemljaric,
speaking before a meeting with the Paris Club of creditor
nations, said Yugoslavia was seeking to refinance two billion
dlrs of debt.
    The official Tanjug news agency quoted Zemljaric as saying
Yugoslavia expected a "definite measure of understanding" from 16
western creditor countries when they meet on March 30.
    Zemljaric was not quoted as saying whether the two billion
dlrs referred to principal or interest or both. Yugoslavia's
hard currency debt stands between 19 and 20 billion dlrs.
    Zemljaric said the International Monetary Fund criticised
Yugoslavia for not regulating consumption, not having real
interest rates or market exchange rates, for its inability to
control monetary policy and slow pace of reform.
    He said the criticisms were in a report by an IMF
commission which visited Yugoslavia last December and January.
    "We cannot accept this assessment because we have made not
inconsiderable progress under difficult conditions, even though
we are aware of our own weaknesses," Zemljaric said.
    He said the report favourably assessed some trends in the
Yugoslav economy but did not say which.
    Milos Milosavljevic, also a Deputy Prime Minister, said
last Friday that Yugoslavia had repaid 640 mln dlrs of
principal and 325 mln dlrs of interest so far in 1987.
    According to official Yugoslav figures, Yugoslavia repaid a
record 5.97 billion dlrs in capital and interest in 1986.
    In an interview with the West German weekly magazine Der
Spiegel, Prime Minister Branko Mikulic said last weekend
Yugoslavia had repaid 28.3 billion dlrs in principal and
interest between 1981 and 1986.

<TITLE>ELECTION RESULT MAY DELAY JAPAN ECONOMIC STIMULUS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Kunio Inoue, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>The ruling Liberal Democratic Party's
(LDP) setback in Sunday's nationwide local elections may force
the government to water down its controversial proposal for a
five pct sales tax and undermine its commitment to stimulating
the economy, private economists said.
    The LDP's failure to win seats in some crucial local
constituencies will weaken the government's ability to push
through its tax plan, and without a compromise tax proposal the
budget for fiscal 1987/88 ending March 31 is unlikely to be
passed soon, they said.
    Without the budget, the government would also be
hard-pressed to come up with an effective package to stimulate
the economy as pledged at Group of Seven meetings in Paris in
late February and in Washington last week, they said.
    Opposition protests against the sales tax have stalled
parliamentary debate on the budget for weeks and forced the
government to enact a stop-gap 1987/88 budget that began early
this month.
    "The LDP's election setback will have an enormous impact on
the already faltering economy," said Johsen Takahashi, chief
economist at Mitsubishi Research Institute.
    Takahashi said that behind the LDP's poor showing was
public discontent with the government's high-handed push for
tax reform and its lack of effective policies to cope with
economic woes caused by the yen's appreciation.
    "This explains why the LDP failed to regain governorships in
the most hotly contested constituencies of Fukuoka and
Hokkaido, where the shipbuilding and steel industries are
suffering heavily from the yen's extended rise," he said.
    Takahashi said the government should delay introduction of
the sales tax for one or two years beyond its original starting
date of January 1988 and implement tax cuts now.

<TITLE>CHINA LIKELY TO JOIN GATT, DIPLOMATS SAY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Mark O'Neill, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>China is likely to succeed in joining
GATT despite policies that contradict free trade, because
western countries support its entry, western diplomats said.
    China applied to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT) in July 1986. The organisation, formed in 1948 to
integrate the world's free market economies, now regulates 80
pct of world trade.
    The GATT secretariat is expected to submit a list of
detailed questions to China next month at the start of long and
complex entry negotiations, the diplomats said.
    One diplomat said China's prospects are good, with its
application supported by the United States, Japan and the
European Community for political and economic reasons.
    "The fear is that if China was refused entry, it would draw
back the bamboo curtain and go back to the way it was," he said.
    Another said the Soviet Union was waiting in the wings.
    "If GATT accepted China, it would be hard not to accept the
Soviet Union," he said.
    "China's agreement will be seen as a model for the Soviet
Union. GATT is not a political body."
    But serious problems have to be tackled during the talks,
including China's pricing system and trade subsidies.
    GATT is based on free trade and aims to lower tariffs and
promote trade, with prices alone dictating who buys what.
    One diplomat said it was very hard in China to establish
the real cost of goods because many prices are set by the state
and often contain subsidies.
    "Even when you go in person to a factory or a company to try
to find out the real cost of something, officials do not give
you a clear answer. The political meaning is evident. They do
not want to answer," he said.
    China's position, as set out in a memorandum to GATT in
February, is that it is gradually reforming its price system to
bring prices in line with real production costs and replace
administrative controls with market ones.
    Another diplomat said countries with centralised economies
such as Hungary and Yugoslavia had joined GATT. However, China
would not apply for membership on similar terms, but rather as
a less developed country entitled to preferential treatment.
    He added that the economies of Hungary and Yugoslavia are
small, while China's is huge and its weight would be felt.
    "It (China) is the world's number two producer of coal, for
instance," the diplomat said. "It could have a very large impact
on world trade."
    Another sticking point is the subsidies China pays its
companies to export so it can earn foreign exchange to pay for
vitally needed technology, equipment and raw materials.
    A Japanese trader said China lost money on every tonne of
grain it exported, because it had to make up the difference
between a low world price and a high domestic price.
    A western diplomat said an official of a foreign trade
bureau of a major inland Chinese city told him export subsidies
might be as high as 100 pct for some products.
    "When I asked what the subsidy figure was for the whole
country, he referred me to the Ministry of Finance, adding with
a grin that they would not tell me," he said.
    He said officials were unwilling to give figures because of
the sensitivity of the subject.
    "Unless something is done to change this, China will find
many countries in GATT putting restrictions on imports from
China," the diplomat added.
    In a major speech on the economy late last month, Planning
Minister Song Ping made an indirect reference to this problem.
    "While trying to expand exports to earn more foreign
exchange, we must improve economic accounting practices and
reduce the cost of exports," he said.
    One diplomat said China's freedom to change its foreign
trade and pricing system to bring them more in line with GATT
principles could conflict with domestic pressures. China has
said there will be no major price reforms this year following
widespread discontent in 1985 and 1986 from a public used to
stable prices since the Communist takeover in 1949.
    "So the question is how fast and how thoroughly can China
reform its economy?," the diplomat said. "How can it balance the
requirements of GATT membership with domestic political needs?"
    But he added the advantages of China's entry would in the
end outweigh these problems.
    "China's entry would force it to modernise and become more a
part of the world economy," he said.
    "Just as China would get increased access to foreign
markets, so it would have to give more access to its domestic
market to foreign countries."

<TITLE>SUMMIT DEEPENS IMF COORDINATION ROLE,OFFICIAL SAYS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Alver Carlson, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Venice summit accord gives the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) increased responsibility in
smoothing vital economic cooperation between industrial
countries, a senior IMF official said.
    The official, who met reporters but asked not to be
identified, made clear that the use of a series of economic
measurements to monitor the seven leading industrial
democracies would be difficult but was a major step in
cooperation.
    The United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain,
Italy and Canada agreed at the summit to use a series of
economic indicators to forecast economic behaviour in an
attempt to increase cooperation on economic policy.
    The setting of a formal process of review, while seen as a
step forward in the cooperative effort, was also criticised
because it lacked teeth to force a country to change economic
behaviour that hurt other countries.
    But the official said influences and peer pressure could
have a major impact in reforming an erring country.
    Economists generally believe a cooperative economic
approach by the largest countries will have a salutory impact
on the global economy, including helping the poorest debtor
countries.
    The official said the IMF function would be to warn
countries when their economic behaviour was straying badly and
try to persuade them to modify it. "I hope it will be a yellow
light, not a red flag," he said.
    He also said he hoped negotiations would begin in the next
few weeks to increase the IMF's structural adjustment facility,
which helps 62 of the world's poorest countries.
    The facility, approved about 15 months ago, is currently
financed at about 3.8 billion dlrs, but this would be tripled
under the plan.
    He said reaching an accord on the agreement would be very
difficult, with countries pressing each other to do more and
finding reasons to reduce their own exposure. "They will be
tremendously difficult negotiations," he said.

<TITLE>U.S. OFFICIALS DISAGREE ON REDUCING DEFICIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Senior U.S. Economic officials
disagree on the likelihood the government can meet its budget
deficit reduction targets.
    Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the Council of Economic
Advisers, reiterated the Reagan Administration's opposition to
a tax increase and its pledge to reduce the deficit by cutting
spending and fostering economic growth.
    By contrast, Rudolph Penner, Director of the Congressional
Budget Office, said the budget process has broken down and the
deficit will remain close to 200 billion dlrs for fiscal 1987.
    Sprinkel told a symposium sponsored by New York University
that spending could be cut by avoiding decisions based on the
desire to influence votes and by shifting the responsibility
for local projects to state governments.
    He also suggested a line-item veto, which allows the
President to veto parts of bill without rejecting all of it, to
limit wasteful spending. Spending and taxing decisions should
be linked more closely.
    Sprinkel said the Administration still looks for 2.7 pct
growth in U.S. Real gross national product (GNP) in 1987 and
3.5 pct in 1988.
    Asked if the latest economic reports signal this rate of
economic growth is attainable, Sprinkel said, "It looks pretty
good to me. We've had two very strong employment reports."
    He also said federal reserve policy is appropriate, adding,
"It looks like they're on track."
    While further reductions are needed in the trade deficit,
Sprinkel said the lower dollar is having an impact.
    The new 1987 tax laws will not hurt the economy and the tax
reform act of 1986 significantly lowers tax rates and will
greatly increase private production incentives, he said.
    "Our estimates at the Council of Economic Advisers suggest
national net output of goods and services will permanently
increase by approximately two pct because of the long-run
consequences of tax reform," Sprinkel said. "In 1986, this would
have amounted to an increase of approximately 600 dlrs in the
income of the average American family."
    Sprinkel also argued the 1981 tax cuts were not responsible
for the large increase in the budget deficit.
    In fiscal 1986 ending September, federal spending amounted
to 23.8 pct of GNP, while federal receipts absorbed 18.5 pct of
GNP, leaving a deficit of 5.3 pct, he said.
    Sprinkel said that, compared with fiscal 1978, the 1986
federal expenditure share of GNP is 2.7 percentage points
higher and the revenue share of GNP is virtually the same.
    "Contrary to the conventional wisdom, therefore, the 1981
tax cut is not the root cause of the extraordinary budget
deficits of the past few years," Sprinkel said.
    "This tax cut merely rolled back the inflation-induced tax
increases that occurred between 1978 and 1981," he added.
    However, the Congressional Budget Office's Rudolph Penner
argued that the tax cut in 1981 was misguided.
    "Since making the big mistake in 1981 of cutting taxes
enormously without any plan to decrease spending by the
Administration or Congress, indeed with increases in defence
spending, now all the options (for reducing the budget deficit)
are unpleasant," he said.
    Penner said the tax cut resulted from the ideological
turmoil in the U.S. Caused by the "biggest sustained inflation
in our nation's history," which helped foster widespread
distrust of government.
    "The American people turned on the government with tax
revolt at the state level and new demands on the government at
the national level," Penner said.
    "But their dislike of taxes exceeded their general dislike
of spending programs. Now the correction of that 1981 mistake
demands that the system change a lot."
    Penner sees little hope the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget
deficit reduction targets will be met and said the deficit will
remain at roughly 200 billion dlrs this year.
    He said a budget process that sets targets arbitrarily is
not likely to succeed.
    "I feel pretty safe in saying that any process that tries to
dictate a numerical outcome from above is doomed to fail simply
because there's no ... Way to enforce it," Penner said.
    Penner questioned the methods by which the 1987 budget
deficit was cut. He said 18 to 19 billion dlrs were eliminated
by one-time measures, such as a temporary increase in taxes
related to tax reform and sales of government assets.
    "Another four billion dlrs was cut by what I call creative
timing changes, like moving the military payday from the last
day of fiscal 1987 to the first day of fiscal 1988. That saved
more than two billion dlrs," Penner said.

<TITLE>U.S. WHEAT GROUPS CALL FOR GLOBAL ACTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>All major grain producing countries
must do their part to help reduce global surpluses and the
recent Australian farm policy proposals are flawed, two U.S.
wheat organizations said.
    The recent Australian proposals were a good starting point
for discussions, "but we do not want the Australians to feel
they are alone in developing an agenda for discussions" on world
grain trade, the president of the National Association of Wheat
Growers, NAWG, and the chairman of U.S. Wheat Associates said
in a letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and U.S.
Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.
    Future discussions on international wheat trade should
include three topics -- a commitment to privatization of
government-run export trading entities, a commitment to public
disclosure of sales and other terms if government entities are
involved, and a recognition that supply reductions by the U.S.
have kept world prices higher than they otherwise would be, the
two organizations said 
    While the Australian proposals are welcome the two
organizations said they are not in total agreement with their
assessments.
    Australia's proposals, which aim to reduce U.S. target
prices and "quarantine" U.S. wheat stocks, would continue to
place the burden of supply adjustment and reform on U.S.
farmers, they said.
      Other countries, including Australia, have benefitted
from the higher world prices that have resulted from past U.S.
acreage and crop reduction programs, the organizations said.
    "We will not continue to hurt ourselves economically -- and
subsidize foreign wheat production -- by unilaterally stocking
grain and changing programs which protect our growers," Jim
Miller, president of NAWG said.
    "We sincerely hope for some type of agreement among the
world's major grain producing nations to reduce stocks and
restore profitability to agriculture," Miller said.

<TITLE>CONGRESS MAY CURB U.S. AID TO DEVELOPMENT BANKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Congressional ire is rising against
the multinational development banks which make loans to help
other countries produce goods in direct competition with
beleagured U.S. farmers and miners.
    With a record U.S. trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs last
year and a farm economy in the doldrums, Congress is pressing
to hold back U.S. funds for the World Bank and other
development banks if the money is used to subsidize production
or to produce goods already in oversupply around the world.
     "American tax dollars are being used to subsidize foreign
agriculture and mineral production that is often in direct
competition with our producers," Senator Don Nickles, an
Oklahoma Republican, said in a letter to fellow senators
seeking support for his legislation to limit these loans.
    Nickles and Senator Steven Symms, a conservative Republican
from Idaho, have introduced legislation that would strictly
limit U.S. funding of multinational development banks if they
make any loans to help developing countries produce surplus
commodities or minerals.
    Current law requires that the United States vote against
such loans but carries no reprisals if they are ultimately
approved by the banks.
    Treasury Secretary James Baker's assurances that U.S.
policy is to oppose these loans did not satisfy concerns raised
at two Senate committee hearings last week.
    Baker told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Foreign
Operations, "As a policy matter, we oppose loans for production
of commodities in oversupply."
    The senators cited a 350-mln-dlr World Bank loan made to
Argentina last year to help it increase its agricultural
exports by one billion dlrs a year by 1989.
    Nickles, Symms and others also have cited other loans such
as a 1985 World Bank loan to Hungary to expand livestock
exports and 500 mln dlrs lent to Thailand from 1981 to 1985 at
low interest rates for agriculture.
    Last year the Republican-controlled Senate voted three
times over the objections of the administration to cut U.S.
funding of development banks by the amount of these loans.
    But even with a 65 to 15 vote in favour of the proposal,
the restrictions were weakened in the final version. Only a
provision directing U.S. officials to vote disapproval cleared
Congress.
    This year's version, called the Foreign Agricultural
Investment Reform (FAIR) Act would require the U.S. to vote
against loans designed to increase production of surplus
commodities and minerals. Also, the recipient countries would
have to prove that the production, marketing and export of the
commodities could be handled without government subsidy.
    If the loan is approved over U.S. objections, the United
States would not increase or replenish funds for that
institution until it agrees to stop making such loans.
    Objections to such loans have most often been raised by
conservative Republicans who have traditionally opposed U.S.
funding for these international development banks.
    But the loss of many jobs to foreign competition has raised
similar concerns among more moderate senators.
    The administration opposes any legislation that would tie
its hands in votes on the loans. It argues there might be
instances in which a country needed the money to continue its
moves toward U.S. policies in other areas.
    Baker said the United States would continue to use its
leverage in the banks to require foreign trade liberalization
measures, often in the form of elimination of subsidies.
    Two House Republicans, Representatives Larry Craig of Idaho
and Beau Bolter of Texas, have introduced the bill. But it
faces stiff opposition in the House Banking Committee which has
blocked its consideration by the House in the past.
    Symms intends to offer the bill as an amendment to any
related legislation this year, an aide said.

<TITLE>ARGENTINA WARNS IT MAY CUT OFF TALKS WITH BANKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By David Hume, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Argentina's Economy Minister Juan
Sourrouille said the "narrow interest" of creditor banks was
holding up an accord to stretch out debt repayments and warned
Argentina may break off negotiations.
    "It is inadmissible that the private narrow interest of some
banks threatens to turn into an insurmountable obstacle for a
policy we have agreed with the international community,"
Sourrouille said.
    Speaking to the International Monetary Fund's Interim
Committee meeting, Sourrouille said Argentina had given ample
proof that it is negotiating seriously with the banks.
    "Today, with that same responsibility, we are clearly
stating that it will be imposible for us to continue
negotiating on that basis."
    A monetary source who heard Sourrouille's speech from a
vantage point close to U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker,
said Baker turned to one of his advisors to ask for the names
of banks that Sourrouille said were stalling on an agreement.
    "Let's give them a call right away," the source quoted Baker
as saying.
    Sourrouille reminded the Interim Committee that the IMF
last February approved a 1.3-billion-dlr stand-by loan and a
longer-term credit, known as an extended Fund Facility for
another 500,000 dlrs.
    But he said that despite Argentina's "disciplined effort" to
achieve inflation-free economic growth, it was unable to obtain
IMF payouts due to the link between that arrangement and
settlement of a separate agreement with creditor banks.
    Sourrouille  stated flatly that the banks were flouting a
long-established practice under which debtor countries which
reached agreements on economic reforms with the Fund were a
good credit risk for the banks.
    "In other words, facts are demonstrating that the current
debt strategy is showing that an IMF agreement is only a weak
signal for the beginning of another discussion (with the
banks)," he stated.
    He added the fact that the strategy is not working was also
demonstrated when governments that approved Argentina's program
had to join in a bridge loan for his country.
    Sourrouille stated that Argentina has met IMF requirements
regarding its balance of payments and its monetary and fiscal
policies.
    Despite this Sourrouille said, "What we are facing is the
inexplicable demands (from the banks) that are blocking
negotations."
    Argentina, with a foreign debt of 50 billion dlrs, has been
seeking to reschdule 24 billion dlrs in "old debt" and another
4.2 billion dlrs that had been refinanced in 1985.
    The minister also said there were two issues separating
Argentina from an accord with creditor banks, one was a minimum
difference on the interest rate margin above international
levels.
    The other condition, of more concern, were suggestions by
the banks that would upset the country's financial system.
    Monetary sources said creditor banks have been offering
Argentina the London Interbank rate (Libor) plus 7/8 pct, which
they gave Venezuela in a recent refinancing agreement.
    The sources said Argentina is committed to winning the
lower spread Mexico gained last year of 13/16 pct above Libor.

<TITLE>CONGRESS EYES LOANS THAT AID U.S. COMPETITORS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jacqueline Frank, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Congressional ire is rising against
the multinational development banks which make loans to help
other countries produce goods in direct competition with
beleagured American farmers and miners.
    With a record trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs last year
and a farm economy in the doldrums, Congress is pressing to
hold back U.S. funds for the World Bank and other development
banks if the money is used to subsidize production or to
produce goods already in oversupply around the world.
    "American tax dollars are being used to subsidize foreign
agriculture and mineral production that is often in direct
competition with our producers," Sen. Don Nickles, an Oklahoma
Republican, said in a letter to fellow senators seeking support
for his legislation to limit these loans.
    Nickles and Sen. Steven Symms, a conservative Republican
from Idaho, have introduced legislation that would strictly
limit U.S. funding of multinational development banks if they
make any loans to help developing countries produce surplus
commodities or minerals.
    Current law requires the United States to vote against such
loans but carries no reprisals if they pass anyway.
    Treasury Secretary James Baker's assurances that U.S.
policy is to oppose these loans did not satisfy concerns raised
at two Senate committee hearings last week.
    Baker told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Foreign
Operations, "as a policy matter, we oppose loans for production
of commodities in oversupply."
    The senators cited a 350 mln dlr World Bank loan made to
Argentina last year to help it increase its agricultural
exports by one billion dlrs a year by 1989.
    Nickles, Symms and others also have cited other loans such
as a 1985 World Bank loan to Hungary to expand livestock
exports and 500 mln dlrs lent to Thailand from 1981 to 1985 at
low interest rates for agriculture. Baker said the Argentine
loan was "really the only one you can point to and criticize."
    Last year the Republican-controlled Senate voted three
times over the objections of the administration to cut U.S.
funding of development banks by the amount of these loans.
    Even with a favorable vote of 65 to 15, the restrictions
were weakened in the final version. Only a provision directing
U.S. officials to vote disapproval was enacted into law.
    This year's proposal, called the Foreign Agricultural

    Also, the recipient countries would have to prove that the
production, marketing and export of the commodities could be

States would not increase or replenish funds for that
institution until it agrees to stop making such loans.
    Objections to such loans have most often been raised by
conservative Republicans who have traditionally opposed U.S.
funding for these international development banks.
    But the loss of many jobs to foreign competition has raised
similar concerns among more moderate senators.
    Democratic senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland told Baker
at the Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing, "Many say the
banks are financing competition for American jobs."
    She recommended that the United States use its
participation in debt forgiveness for developing country loans
as a wedge to open markets to U.S. goods.
    The administration opposes any legislation that would tie
its hands in votes on the loans. It argues there might be
instances in which a country needed the money to continue its
moves toward U.S. policies in other areas.
    Baker said the United States would continue to use its

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - CHINA MUST PRESERVE FARMLAND</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Mark O'Neill, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    FENGBANG COUNTY, China, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>"If we go on using up
farmland as we have done since 1980, there will be none left in
20 years to grow grain on."
    Xu Jinfeng, a middle-aged official in Fengbang village on
the edge of Shanghai, sums up the dilemma China faces as it
tries to feed its more than one billion people and at the same
time let them get richer by building factories and new homes.
    China has to feed one quarter of the world's population,
but only one seventh of its land is arable.
    Sharp increases in farm output since 1979 turned China into
a net grain exporter for the first time in 1985, and again in
1986.
    But the rapid industrialisation of the countryside which
has occurred at the same time, has gobbled up arable land for
factories and homes for peasants who can now afford them.
    Official figures show that China lost just under one pct of
its arable land to other uses in 1985 and a slightly smaller
amount last year. It gained 26 mln new mouths to feed during
the two years.
    "We lost very little land prior to 1980 when the
industrialisation began," official Xu said. "Since then, nearly
all the families in the county have built new homes and many
factories have gone up."
    "Last year we lost land to a new railway line," Xu said. But
land losses in future should fall because nearly all families
already have new houses, she added.
    The issue of land loss is a matter of major concern to the
Peking leadership, which announced earlier this month that
China will issue nationwide quotas for conversion of grain land
for the first time this year.
    "The present situation of abusing, occupying unlawfully,
wasting and destroying land and land resources is serious," said
an article in the official press explaining the new measures.
    "It has resulted in great losses of cultivated farmland," it
said. "China has a large population and its land resources are
badly deficient."
    An official of the Shanghai city government said county
authorities could approve conversion of only 0.3 hectares of
arable land to other uses, while anything more than that must
be approved by the city government.
   The Peking government faces another major obstacle in its
efforts to ensure China's people get enough grain to eat. The
prices the state pays to farmers for grain are too low, making
it more profitable for them to grow other crops.
    To offset this, the state offers farmers cheap fertiliser
and diesel oil and payment in advance for grain it contracts to
buy. The state then sells the grain at subsidised prices to
China's 200 mln city residents. Rural factories also subsidise
grain output, paying farmers bonuses to grow it.
    Some officials argue that the simplest solution to the
problem would be for the state to raise city grain prices.
    Chen Zuyuan, Communist Party secretary of a village in the
eastern province of Zhejiang, said the government listened too
much to the demands of "selfish city people" and could raise city
grain prices without any problem.
    But the government has ruled out a price rise. "Raising the
price of grain would directly conflict with the goal of social
stability," said a China Daily editorial this month.
    The Shanghai official said prices must be reformed over the
long term. "We must be very careful. We have a very large
population which is used to price stability and will object to
price rises," he said. "The problem is how to do it."
    The Shanghai official said a rise in grain prices might
also affect the prices of hundreds of food products made with
grain and consumed by city residents.
    In addition, the state faces the problem of inadequate
investment by farmers in land and in grain in particular.
    The official press has reported that farmers fear farm
policy may change and they are putting their new wealth into
building graves, memorial halls for ancestors and homes.
    Under reforms introduced in the late 1970s, farmers sign
contracts with the state requiring them to grow certain crops,
but they have considerable freedom in how to use their land.
    "As the expiration date of the 15-year contract is almost at
the halfway mark, farmers are beginning to worry about the
future," the China Daily said in an editorial last month.
    Their anxieties stem from the fact that they are allowed to
use the land but not own it. For most of the period of
Communist rule, the land was organised into collectives where
there was little room for individual initiative.
    "New measures are needed to reassure them of the consistency
of government policies and make them interested in long-term
investment," the newspaper said.

<TITLE>YUGOSLAV ECONOMIC PLAN SEEN FACING HURDLES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Andrej Gustincic</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BELGRADE, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Yugoslavia's ambitious economic recovery
and anti-inflation plan faces major hurdles before it can be
implemented, Yugoslav economists and Western diplomats said.
    Prime Minister Branko Mikulic on Monday proposed new taxes
hitting high income earners, moonlighters, property and
interest on savings as part of new government plans to rein in
the country's 123 pct inflation.
    He also proposed price and wage restraint and the trimming
of repayments on the 20 billion dlr foreign debt in line with
currency earning abiltiy.
    "The taxes will anger many Yugoslavs struggling with
soaring prices and will be resisted in Parliament," a Western
diplomatic source said. Yugoslav economists said Mikulic's
draft plans left many questions unanswered.
    "It was a list of goals, not concrete measures," said a
senior Yugoslav economist at a leading Yugoslav research
institute.
    The state news agency Tanjug was more optimistic. It said
the proposals indicated "real economic reforms" were coming.
    Further details of the program, which Mikulic summarised in
Parliament, are to appear in the days ahead, and the draft has
to be debated and voted on by deputies in November.
    "The goals are good," a leading Belgrade economist said.
"No one can argue with that. But the million dollar question,
as with all government programs here, is how they will be
implemented."
    Zoran Popov, senior research fellow at The Belgrade
Institute for Industrial Economy said the existing system made
many of the proposals difficult to put into effect.
    "A change in the the system of taxation requires changes in
the constitution," he said. "Mikulic's speech tells us what he
wants to do, but not how."
    "It may be anti-inflationary," one diplomat said. "But the
question is how can you tax a black economy and how will the
government find out who has two jobs or more than one home."
    Economists and diplomats said the proposals could be
resisted by deputies from several of Yugoslavia's constituent
republics and provinces in defence of regional interests.
    Such resistance has blocked the nationwide implementation
of federal government economic policy on many past occasions.

<TITLE>U.S. TREASURY'S BAKER OPPOSES TAX INCREASE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker
said that he opposes a Federal tax increase to help reduce the
budget deficit and favors spending cuts instead.
    "I don't think it's (a tax increase) is a very good idea
and I'm quite confident that President Reagan doesn't think
it's a very good idea," Baker said in an interview on Cable
News Network's "Moneyline" television program.
    He said U.S. taxpayers are taxed at a rate of 19 pct of GNP
which is traditionally where it has been, but the Federal
Government is spending at a rate of 24 pct of GNP. Baker said
spending cuts are clearly the best way to cut budget deficits.
    Baker said he opposed a stock transactions tax proposed by
House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Tex, or other special taxes.
    "The stock transfer tax would be a particularly unfortunate
approach to take," the Treasury Secretary said. He said the
United States has some of the most efficient capital markets in
the world and new taxes would impair efficiency.
    On the international front, Baker said banks must do more
lending to developing countries. He was questioned about this
after the Standard and Poor's Corp downgrading today of the
debt of six major money center bank holding companies, largely
because of their heavy developing nation loan exposure.
    Baker said that developing countries must adopt free market
economic policies such as in the United States. He said capital
flows will be required to support the needed reforms in the
economic systems of those countries.
    The money must come either through equity or debt and Baker
said that developing nations' "investment regimes do not
support enough equity investment, so you've got to have some
debt there."
    Commenting on the U.S. trade deficit, Baker said "I think
you're going to see a 15 to 20 billion dlr reduction this
year."

<TITLE>JAPAN RULING PARTY SEEKS BIG SUPPLEMENTARY BUDGET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The ruling Liberal Democratic Party has
drawn up the guidelines of an economic package including a
supplementary budget of more than 5,000 billion yen, a senior
party official said.
    It also urged the government to concentrate in the first
half of the current fiscal year which began on April 1 a record
proportion of the year's public works spending, he said.
    The LDP also suggested the government review the ceiling on
budgetary requests for investment in public works projects
presented by individual ministries, he added.
    But the LDP official said the government should not abandon
its fiscal reform target of ending the issue of
deficit-covering bonds by fiscal 1990.
    These measures should be treated as an emergency, partly
because of the urgent need for Japan to redress its external
trade imbalance with the U.S., He said.
    The guidelines will be explained to the U.S. This week when
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa visits Washington for the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) meeting, he added.
    The official, the LDP Policy Affairs Research Council's
Chairman Masayoshi Ito, told a press conference the proposed
supplementary budget will probably be compiled no earlier than
August but before November.
    The guideline will be the basis for a more detailed
reflationary plan to be worked out by the LDP before Prime
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone leaves for Washington on April 29
for talks with President Reagan, Ito said.
    The full government-endorsed economic package is expected
to be announced in late May.
    The LDP expects public works spending in the first 1987/88
half to account for more than 80 pct of what was originally
incorporated in the fiscal 1987 budget, Ito said. The previous
record for the rate was 77.5 pct in 1986/87.
    Ito said revenue sources for the additional pump-priming
measures should include the issue of construction bonds and the
use of part of the proceeds from sales of the privatized Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone Corp stocks.
    An LDP statement said the government should use the
additional budget mainly to encourage housing construction and
to revitalize regional economies hit hard by the yen's rise.

<TITLE>FED CHAIRMAN VOLCKER SAYS BANK PROPOSALS A WORRY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>The chairman of the Federal Reserve
Board, Paul Volcker, has written to the chairman of the House
Banking Committee to raise concerns about legislative proposals
scheduled for consideration Wednesday.
    Volcker told committee chairman Fernand St. Germain a
proposal to deny primary dealer status to firms from countries
that do not grant U.S. firms equal access to their government
debt markets might invite retaliation against U.S. firms
abroad.
    He added, "even Japan, against whom this proposal seems to
be particularly directed," has started opening its markets.
    In his letter, made available at the Treasury, Volcker also
said a proposal to ease debt problems of developing countries
by setting up a public facility to buy their debts owed to
commercial banks, was a problem.
    "I believe that the prospect of debt relief would undermine
the difficult internal efforts of the borrowing countries to
achieve the structural reform that is needed regardless of the
policies that are followed on servicing external debt," Volcker
said.
    It might also cause private lenders to become reluctant to
extend more credit to the borrowing countries, he said.
    Volcker said he endorsed comments by Treasury Secretary
James Baker "about the inappropriateness of using public
resources for purchasing private commercial bank debt, which we
both see as an inherent aspect of the proposed international
debt facility."
    He also said a proposal for establishing formal procedures
for international negotiations on currency exchange rates "is
unrealistic and could well have damaging effects."
    "For example, the bill's directive to intitiate negotiations
in order to achieve a competitive exchange rate for the dollar
-- a matter upon which there can be considerable difference
among analysts -- runs the risk of building up potentially
destabilizing market expectations," Volcker said.
    He recommended "we should not lock ourselves into formalized
procedures for international negotiations" on exchange rates but
instead use other, more flexible means like the recent mmeting
in Paris between U.S. treasury and central bank representatives
and those of major trade allies.

    The full government-endorsed economic package is expected
to be announced in late May.
    The LDP expects public works spending in the first 1987/88
half to account for more than 80 pct of what was originally
incorporated in the fiscal 1987 budget, Ito said. The previous
record for the rate was 77.5 pct in 1986/87.
    Ito said revenue sources for the additional pump-priming
measures should include the issue of construction bonds and the
use of part of the proceeds from sales of the privatized Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone Corp stocks.
    An LDP statement said the government should use the
additional budget mainly to encourage housing construction and
to revitalize regional economies hit hard by the yen's rise.

<TITLE>FINNISH TAXATION MAJOR ISSUE IN ELECTION CAMPAIGN</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Verschoor, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    HELSINKI, March 5 -  </DATELINE><BODY>Personal taxation has emerged as the
major economic issue in Finnish general elections later this
month, and Conservative gains could mark a shift towards
indirect taxation and accelerate moves towards more
market-oriented banking practices, economists say.
    Opinion polls indicate the Conservative Party, Finland's
second largest, may gain enough clout after the elections to
join a coalition government which is still likely to be
dominated by the Social Democrats of Prime Minister Kalevi
Sorsa.
    But the economists point out that Conservative economic
policies differ only slightly from the governments', and that
trade with the Soviet Union will not be affected.
    Helsinki bankers said a new government, including the
Conservatives for the first time in 20 years, could bring about
a shift from direct to indirect taxation.
    The present coalition of Social democrats and Centrists has
embarked on a tax reform programme to cut marginal taxation,
which is up to 75 pct in the highest income scales. The
opposition has also called for reforms, but they differ over
how to regain lost state revenues.
    One Conservative favoured possibility is abolishing tax
exemption on interest from bank deposits and government bonds.
    Hannu Halttunen, of Helsinki bank Kansallis-Osake-Pankki
(KOP), told Reuters "We want to be more free in setting interest
rates and in creating different deposits to suit the individual
investors. If tax on interest is introduced, then we prefer a
system with taxation of real interest gains."
    Under present laws, bank customers are exempted from tax on
interest when banks jointly set interest rates. Bankers said
this had encouraged cartel-style banking and was hindering
tougher inter-bank competition.
    A London-based Nordic banking expert said liberalisation
was too strong a word to use in a Finnish context, but a
Conservative presence could dislodge traditional practices.
    "It would probably result in new practices that have been
seen elsewhere for a few years growing rather more quickly in
Finland," he said, in a reference to money market instruments.
    All parties, especially the Conservatives, have been
careful to avoid making Finnish-Soviet trade an election issue.
Moscow is Finland's largest trading partner. Until a few years
ago the Conservative Party was seen as anti-communist, but has
now moderated its stance, political analysts say.
    Trade between Helsinki and Moscow is based on a barter
system, and is balanced under long-term accords.
    In January the two countries signed a 1987 agreement worth
30 billion markka, but trade in the past two years has been
declining due to the fall in the price of crude oil, which
accounts for 80 pct of Finnish imports from the Soviet Union.
    The bankers said taxation had become the major economic
theme of the campaign because there were few other issues.
    Inflation was 3.4 pct in 1986, compared with 5.9 pct in
1985, and unemployment has increased slightly from 6.1 pct of
the workforce in 1985 to last year's levels of 6.7 pct.
    The Social democrats in 1986 doubled the country's foreign
trade surplus compared with 1985, from 2.50 billion markka to
5.04 billion markka.
    Opinion polls say Sorsa's Social Democrats will remain the
largest party in the 200-seat Parliament, with some 26 pct of
the vote. They currently hold 57 seats.
    The Centre Party, the other major coalition partner, is
also expected to hold on to its 37 seats.
    But increased Conservative support and a decline for the
Communists could make force Sorsa to allow the Conservatives
into government. They currently hold 44 seats.

<TITLE>CONABLE WARNS PROTECTIONISM MIGHT SPREAD</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Alver Carlson, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>World Bank President Barber Conable
expressed concern that trade protectionism, at the heart of a
new showdown between the United States and Japan, might spread
throughout the industrial world.
    But in an interview with Reuters, Conable said the action
by the United States to slap tariffs on certain electronic
goods from Japan did not mean the countries were heading for a
full-scale trade war.
    Conable said the World Bank has been pressing developing
countries to open their markets, arguing that a free trading
environment increased the possibility of global economic
growth.
    "We have, in fact, been making adjustment loans to many
countries in the developing world which have encouraged the
opening of their markets and we want to be sure that the
developed world doesn't close at the same time," he said.
    He said the U.S. action against Japan was "a significant
retaliatory step but it did not constitute a basic change in
trade policy."
    The interview came just before next week's semi-annual
meetings of the Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
    Referring to Brazil's recent interest payments moratorium,
Conable also said the global debt situation was very serious
and must be closely watched.
    He said the Bank, which in the past has concentrated on
making loans that assist the basic underpinnings in the
developing world such as dams, roads and sewers, will
increasingly make assistance available for economic reform.
    The Bank has increased these loans, in part because of the
debt crisis that has found countries desperately in need of new
funds for balance of payments adjustment and economic reforms
aimed at opening their markets, encouraging foreign investment
and reducing government's role in the economy.
    "We're comfortable with adjustment lending, we expect,
however, that it will never reach a majority of our portfolio,"
Conable said.
    He made clear, however, that adjustment lending would
continue to increase as a proportion of overall Bank lending
for some time.
    He noted, "the problem of debt was a severe one and many
countries are asking for adjustment assistance because of the
problem of debt."
    Conable, is a a former Republican Congressman from New York
chosen by President Reagan for the Bank position last year. He
is an associate of Treasury Secertary James Baker who launched
the U.S. strategy for shoring up indebted nations in October,
1985 which included a call for increased adjustment lending by
the World Bank.
    Conable also said that he expected the result of a major
study of the Bank's organization to be completed in the next
several weeks.
    He said the decision to seek a reorganization was based, in
part, on the fact that the Bank had come under fire from the
poorest countries for not doing enough to help and from the
richest countries because of inefficiency.
    the reorganization is considered a major initiative by
Conable, and is being closely-watched by the agency's 151
member-countries as an indication of his management style and
priorities.
    "I want to be sure this institution is viewed by those who
must support it as soundly constituted so that it will be
permitted to grow," Conable said.
    However, he said "I don't believe there is anything
basically wrong with this institution and I don't believe it
has to have any redefinition of its purpose."
    He said, however, that it was apparent that the debt
initiative proposed by Baker has given the Bank a central role
in dealing with the debt crisis.
    Conable added that cooperation between the Bank and its
sister agency, the International Monetary Fund, was good and
that he talked often with IMF Managing Director Michel
Camdessus on a variety of issues.
    On a personal level, Conable said that he not feel a need
to put his personal stamp on the Bank noting that "I don't have
a particular mission here except to be useful to the
institution and to the process of development."
    He added, "so I don't feel a great calling to personalize
the institution."
    On the development needs of sub-Sahara Africa, Conable said
that the Bank was constantly reviewing new ways for assisting
the region, noting that half of the recently agreed financing
of 12.4 billion dlrs for Bank's International Development
Association was earmarked for Africa.
    Leading industrial nations are expected to consider new
forms of debt relief for the very poorest nations, like those
in the Sub-Sahara, during next week's meetings.

<TITLE>U.S., LATIN NATIONS DELAY DECISION ON IADB</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Torday, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    MIAMI, March 22 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States and major Latin
American nations agreed to set aside sharp differences over
control of the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) and
reconsider the issue this summer.
    The bank's policy-making board of governors, meeting here
ahead of this week's IADB annual meetings, put off any
decisions when it became apparent differences between
Washington and the Latin countries ware too great.
    IABD officials said Washington had indicated, however, it
might be prepared to compromise in the future.
    The United States is the principal donor nation and has
pressed the bank, controlled by the Latin American borrowing
nations, to cede virtual veto power over loans to Washington.
    The Reagan administration wants to make the bank part of
its controversial strategy to resolve the debt crisis.
    The U.S. Plan calls for loans from multilateral banks like
the IADB to be tied to economic reforms in debtor nations which
would promote open markets, reduced government intervention and
inflation-free economic growth.
    Brazil, which declared an interest payments moratorium last
month, is leading a challenge to Washington's strategy and
officials here obviously feared any decisions that might deepen
rifts between the United States and Third World nations.
    IADB officials also said Washington hinted at future
compromise. "The U.S. Said it remains hopeful they can reach an
agreement and expressed optimism that such a consensus could be
reached," said an official who asked not to be named.
    Washington has threatened to scuttle a 20-25 billion dlr,
four-year capital replenishment for the bank if the veto issue
is not resolved.
    But it has asked Congress to give it authority to finance
its one-third share in the event agreement on voting power is
reached. The United States controls 34.5 pct of the vote and
wants a loan veto to exist at the 35 pct level.
    Currently, a simple majority can approve or disapprove
loans giving the borrowing nations control of the purse strings
and resulting in loan conditions too lax for Washington's
taste.
    The U.S. Strategy for dealing with the debt crisis is
expected to be repeated by Treasury Secretary James Baker in a
speech to the bank's annual meeting on Monday.
    But monetary sources expect Baker to suggest the United
States has some room for compromise and also to fend off other
challenges to its strategy by signalling Washington is open to
innovative solutions to the debt problem.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>INDIAN BUDGET COMES IN FOR WIDE CRITICISM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW DELHI, March 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Opposition politicians, businessmen
and newspapers criticised India"s newly unveiled 1987/88 budget
and large projected deficit of around 57 billion rupees.
    They said the budget failed to provide incentives for
economic growth and merely tinkered with tax reform.
    But few politicians were prepared to criticise a sharp rise
in defence expenditure in the Hindu-majority nation where
playing on fear of aggression by Moslem Pakistan has proved a
vote winner. The Indian Express, the country"s biggest selling
paper, said: "The defence cow has never been holier."
    The Sunday Mail newspaper branded the budget "shamelessly
political." It said in a front page commentary the "budget is bad
for growth, bad for prices, bad for the stock market and
neutral in respect of everything else."
    Businessmen polled by Reuters said the budget had done
little for them.
    Gandhi announced small increases in poverty alleviation and
education outlays but he ordered a hold-down on current
expenditure in an attempt to rein in the budget deficit. He
told ministries to curb spending and promised a review of
money-losing public sector industries.
    Gandhi lowered import tariffs on some computer parts but
otherwise did little to extended the economic liberalisation
policy launched two years ago.
    Reaction in Bombay, India"s business capital, was generally
unfavourable.
    Businessmen and economists said the budget had no proposals
for closing the 1987/88 budget deficit. It also failed to boost
industrial investment and productivity needed to lift real
economic growth above the five pct a year envisaged by the
1985-90 development plan.
    Nalin Vissanji, President of the Indian Merchants Chambers
of Commerce said the budget gave no incentives to the capital
market and had not fulfilled a government pledge to remove
surtax on corporate income.
    Shares on The Bombay Stock Exchange, India"s biggest, fell
in a post-budget session yesterday but brokers welcomed Gandhi"s
proposal to set up a regulatory board for the securities
industry.
    The exchange was shaken last year by several scandals and
trading was suspended several times.
    Brokers said trading volume may increase with the change in
capital gains tax on stock sales.
    Stockholders can now sell shares after one year instead of
three years without incurring capital gains tax.
    Stock Exchange President Ramdas Dalal said yesterday the
fall in share prices after the budget came as profits were
taken and he expected to the market to firm in days to come.

<TITLE>DEBT PROGNOSIS AGREED, BUT NO CURE IN SIGHT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOSTON, MARCH 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Latin America urgently needs more money
if it is to grow its way out of its deepening debt crisis, but
fresh ideas about how to stimulate new lending quickly seem to
be in short supply.
    Bankers, officials and academics at a conference organized
by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology stressed the
importance of proper economic policies and increased private
investment. But they offered no glimpse of a grand design to
banish the specter of a widespread repudiation of the region's
380 billion dlr debt. "Such a solution is still not in sight,"
said Nobel Prize-winning economist Franco Modigliani.
    The conference was held against the background of the
recent suspension of interest payments by Brazil and Ecuador,
but it was Argentine finance secretary Mario Brodersohn who
spelled out most clearly the social and economic strains caused
by the need to service billions of dlrs of debt.
    Brodersohn, who is negotiating currently with foreign banks
for a 2.15 billion dlr loan for 1987, says Argentina will have
to grow at a four pct annual rate between now and 1992 simply
to restore per capita income to the level of 1975.
    He said the investment needed to fuel this growth can come
partly from structural economic reforms at home, but this alone
will not be enough.
    "We have to reduce the transfer of resources," Brodersohn
said, adding that mounting economic strains in Latin America
make this a matter of urgency.
    Brodersohn and other Latin officials, however, did not
spell out how this should be achieved.
    The creditors' strategy, spelled out by U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Baker in October 1985, is to spur additional
lending by private banks and multilateral development banks in
return for economic reforms.
    But there was a widespread recognition at the conference
that the Baker Plan has fallen well short of expectations.
    Miguel Urrutia, a senior official of the Inter-American
Development Bank, for instance, said IADB lending had actually
declined in 1986 and had started slowly in 1987.
    Mexico is due to sign a 7.7 billion dlr loan on Friday that
will be the first major facility under the Baker Plan, which
called for net new bank lending between 1986 and 1988, a target
that Morris Goldstein of the International Monetary Fund said
is now optimistic.
    Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American
Affairs Paul Taylor acknowledged that the Baker Plan "has not
yet succeeded as well as we hoped."
    But if the debtors at the conference were hoping to hear an
official commitment to try a new tack, they must have been
disappoiunted.
    Ted Truman, director of the International Finance Diviision
at the Federal Reserve Board, said banks were short-sighted in
not lending promptly and in the amounts called for by Baker.
    He said some streamlining of the lending process may be
needed, but added, "I see no alterantive to the present course
of responsible cooperation."
    A major theme at the conference, however, was that the
world economy might not continue to cooperate while the debtors
and creditors muddle along. If export markets dry up because of
recession or protectionism, speakers warned, Latin America will
be even more hard-pressed to service its debts.
    Rimmer de Vries, chief international economist at Morgan
Guaranty Trust Co, said he was very concerned that world
economic growth of three to 3-1/2 pct cannot be sustained and
that West Germany and Japan wowuld not take up the slack in the
world economy that will arise as the U.S. narrows its trade
deficit.
    "There's a deflationary force coming down the mountain, and
I don't know who's going to be rolled over," de Vries said. He
called for a new lending initiative with a wide menu of options
as alternatives to pure new money.
    "Can we not manage this lending a bit more imaginatively?"
he asked the conference.
    But new ideas take time to devise and implement, and
Brazil's suspension of interest payments shows that the
aptience of debtors might be wearing thin.
    Persio Arida, a former director of the Brazizlian central
bank who was a key architect of that country's Cruzado plan to
curb inflation, said there is an "incentive problem" throughout
Latin America.

<TITLE>TENSE TRADE TIES TO DOMINATE EC TALKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>Tense trade relations with the U.S.
And Japan and concern about the foreign impact of a proposed
European Community (EC) tax on edible oils and fats are
expected to dominate talks by EC foreign ministers here
tomorrow.
    EC diplomats said Britain demanded the early debate on the
EC Executive Commission's proposal to impose a hefty tax on
domestic and imported oils and fats in an attempt to head off a
proposal it sees as extremely damaging to EC foreign relations.
    The proposal was the most controversial part of a reform
package, due to be discussed by EC farm ministers later this
month, of the EC's Common Agricultural Policy -- widely seen as
the root cause of the EC's persistent financial problems and of
tensions with major trading partners.
    The proposal is described by its promoters as a
stabilisation program which would penalise a new sector going
into massive overproduction and complement proposals to cut
cereals and dairy production, rather than a straight forward
tax.
    They say it would not only curb the growth of oils and fats
production and prevent imports from filling any vaccum left by
a fall in EC output, but would also save the EC some two
billion European Currency Units, over two billion dlrs, in farm
costs.
    It has provoked strong protests from domestic producers as
well as foreign exporters, led by the United States.
    The diplomats said the protests had been received from most
corners of the developing and developed world, ranging from
Senegal, Malaysia and Indonesia, to Brazil, Argentina, Canada,
Iceland and Norway.
    The proposal had little chance of approval by EC
governments, with West Germany as strongly opposed to it as
Britain, and Denmark, the Netherlands and Portugal also
unconvinced of its political or economic wisdom.
    Even Mediterranean countries such as Italy, France and
Greece, which backed similar proposals in the past, did not
seem as enthusiastic now because olive oil had been added to
the list of products affected.
    But the diplomats said a protectionist lobby in the U.S.
And elsewhere was using the proposal as an excuse to promote
anti-EC action, and the foreign ministers' debate should
demonstrate the strength of feeling against the proposal within
the EC and deprive its oponents of this argument.
    The ministers were also due to discuss proposals in the
U.S. Congress for a range of protecionist legislation such as a
bill that would curb EC textile exports.
    The diplomats said the ministers were expected to strongly
back a Commission warning to Washington that such a bill, if
enacted, would provoke swift EC retaliation.

<DATELINE>    LUXEMBOURG, April 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>European Community (EC) leaders hope
to make a new attempt to inject fresh urgency into talks on
reforming the bloc's controversial farm policy when EC
agriculture ministers meet for a third day of discussions here
this morning.
    Community officials said farm commissioner Frans Andriessen
met Belgian minister Paul de Keersmaeker late last night to
plan a new initiative.
    Both Andriessen and de Keersmaeker, who currently chairs EC
farm ministers' meetings, were said to be disappointed by the
lack of progress in the talks so far this week.
    The bloc's executive Commission has proposed a tough
package involving effective cuts of upwards of 10 pct in
farmers' returns for many crops this year.
    Ministers were due to have adopted a package by April 1 but
are only this week getting down to serious negotiations.
    Yesterday, they discussed plans to cut cereals prices by
2.5 pct, and reduce farmers' rights to sell surpluses to EC
stores, to cut prices for fruit and vegetables by larger
margins, and to impose a tax on EC-produced and imported
oilseeds, a proposal which would be likely to sour EC trade
relations with the United States.
    Diplomatic sources said ministers, all of whom are opposed
to at least one of these propositions, maintained entrenched
positions yesterday, making the task of de Keersmaeker in
steering his colleagues towards a compromise a daunting one.
    They said he could also be treading a minefield if he
sought to breach the divide between his fellow ministers over
plans to change the system by which EC farm prices, expressed
in a notional common currency, are translated into the
currencies of member states.
    West German minister Ignaz Kiechle indicated yesterday he
would veto the adoption of Commission proposals in this area,
saying they would unfairly affect farmers in strong currency
nations.
    The Belgian sources said de Keersmaeker may today present a
paper to his colleagues which, while not having the status of a
compromise proposal, would attempt to narrow their options.
    But diplomats said the philosophical gap between ministers
like Kiechle, with his commitment to maintaining traditional
rural patterns, and others who see runaway farm spending as
unacceptable economically, is likely to prove extremely
difficult to bridge.
    They agreed with EC farmers' union association president
Hans Kjeldsen who said yesterday that an agreement in June
appeared to be the best that could be hoped for.

<TITLE>EC CONSIDERS NEW PROPOSALS TO END FARM DEADLOCK</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Gerrard Raven, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LUXEMBOURG, June 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community (EC) executive
Commission will today urgently consider whether to take a new
initiative to break the current deadlock over reform of the
bloc's farm policy and to ease its budgetary crisis.
    The Commission will meet in Strasbourg following what
diplomats described as a largely fruitless special joint
meeting of farm and finance ministers on the issue in
Luxembourg Monday.
    Commission officials said farm commissioner Frans
Andriessen will ask the 17-man body for permission to present
farm ministers with a compromise plan revising proposals for
1987/88 farm prices which have divided them since they were
first announced in March.
    The most controversial aspects of these proposals are a
plan to tax all vegetable and marine oils and fats to finance
rapidly increasing production subsidies and technical measures
which would change the way common EC farm prices are converted
into member state currencies.
    West German delegation sources, who have opposed both plans
fiercely, said if the Commission dropped the oils and fats tax
plan and modified the currency proposals, there would be a
chance of agreement on other aspects of the package.
      These include measures to cut the effective price paid to
farmers for cereals and some other crops by over 10 pct.
      But a Commission spokesman said any new proposals would
include plans for revising the current oils and fats and
currency regulations.
     The Commission is anxious to avoid a complete deadlock in
meetings of EC farm ministers here this week as it fears issues
could then be referred to the EC heads of government summit at
the end of the month.
    Commission president Jacques Delors, who wants to ensure
the summit has ample time to consider proposals for new means
of financing the cash-strapped EC, said yesterday it would be
"disastrous" if farm issues had to be discussed by government
leaders.
    However, with a five billion European Currency Unit (5.75
billion dollar) EC budget deficit almost inevitable this year,
the Commission will be wary of making major concessions to the
traditionally free-spending farm ministers, diplomats said
    Belgian finance minister Mark Eyskens, who chaired
yesterday's joint meeting of ministers, said afterwards some
aspects of the farm price package will almost certainly have to
be referred to the summit.
    Although Delors' aides described the joint meeting as
useful in clarifying the issues, some diplomats said it seemed
to have merely confirmed member states' long held positions.
    Indeed, they said an extra state, Spain, seemed to have
lined up with the four others already opposing the oils and
fats tax, West Germany, Britain, Denmark and Portugal.

<TITLE>U.S. TAKES TOUGH STAND ON GATT FARM ISSUES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Lisa Vaughan</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States is prepared to "pull out
all the stops" to defend its agricultural trade rights under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), U.S. Ambassador
to GATT Michael Samuels said.
    Those rights are now being challenged by the European
Community's (EC) agricultural support policies, he told a
conference sponsored by the American Soybean Association.
    He reiterated Washington's firm intention to retaliate if
the EC goes ahead and bans imports of hormone-fed beef without
the issue being investigated by a GATT special committee.
    The U.S. claims the EC directive, due to come into effect
on January 1, threatens to cut 100 mln dlrs worth of U.S. meat
shipments into the EC.
    The U.S. also will oppose all EC efforts to impair U.S.
trade via the EC oilseeds regime, which supports EC oilseed
prices over the current market level and which may be extended
to include a hotly disputed oils and fats tax, Samuels said.
    Reduction of trade-distorting world agricultural subsidies,
an aim of most key participants in GATT multilateral trade
negotiations, "is meaningless if import barriers continue to be
erected," Samuels said.
    Samuels called the U.S. plan to eliminate world farm
subsidies by the year 2000, proposed at GATT in July, "visionary"
and "very serious."  The EC and Japan have said it is
unrealistic.
    The EC Commission this month announced its draft proposal
on farm trade reform, expected to be tabled at GATT formally
next week.
    The EC scheme involves emergency measures to reduce
tensions in troubled surplus sectors of cereals and cereals
substitutes, dairy and sugar. It also calls for reduction of
farm subsidies.
    The U.S. Is not opposed to short-term measures, as long as
they are directly linked to long-term commitments to end major
trade distortions, Samuels said.
    Washington will review the EC proposal when it is formally
submitted and respond to it officially then.
    "We will consider its relation to the Punta del Este
declaration to correct trade problems and expand market access,"
the U.S. Ambassador said.
    The U.S. can say no to the EC proposal if the EC ignores
the U.S. plan when it tables its own proposal, he added.
    The key difference between the two approaches is that the
U.S. wants farm subsidies eliminated, while the EC is pushing
only for a reduction in farm suppports, Samuels said.
    If the EC farm budget were protected by a subsidy freeze,
there would be little incentive for the Community to work to
correct the international trade situation, he added.
    Samuels cited the animal hormones complaint, the EC
oilseeds regime and an EC regulation concerning meat imports to
third countries as three crucial barriers to trade which the
U.S. wants to see resolved under the auspices of GATT.

<TITLE>NAKASONE EXPECTED TO SURVIVE SALES TAX DEFEAT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Janet Snyder, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's
unpopular sales tax plan has been defeated and although fellow
politicians and political analysts agree he has suffered a
grave loss of face only a few are willing to write him off.
    Michio Watanabe, a Nakasone faction member and deputy
secretary general of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, LDP,
is one of those who believes he will survive.
    "He's tough, he won't step down," but "will hang on to the
death" at least until his term ends on October 30, Watanabe told
Reuters.
    The sales tax scheme was a mainstay in Nakasone's plans to
revamp the nation's tax system for the first time in 36 years.
Watanabe acknowledged that the five pct sales tax was a
mistake.
    "It was too greedy," he said. A two or three pct tariff might
have been easier to swallow, he said.
    One popular school of thought among skeptical analysts is
that Nakasone will be remain in office at least until the June
8-10 summit of industrialised nations in Venice.
    A Western diplomatic observer said he believed that
Nakasone would be at the summit as prime minister. But he would
not bet on his chances of survival up until October.
    Masamichi Inoki, a senior fellow at the conservative
Institute of Peace and Security, said he did not think Nakasone
had suffered irreparable damage.
    "He will certainly hang on for the summit," Inoki said.
    In any event, the general belief now is that the five pct
sales tax, as championed by Nakasone, is a dead issue but that
an indirect tax, in another form, will be introduced by the
LDP.
    Inoki said he believed the issue would be resurrected as
early as the next Diet (parliament) meets. The current session
finishes on May 27.
    The newspaper Tokyo Shimbun expressed another stream of
opinion, stating that Nakasone might well get another year to
deal with the unfinished and unpopular business of tax reform.
    The government has to find a way of generating revenue to
support an expected glut of elderly Japanese.
    And the only means of drumming up the money is to levy an
indirect tax, said Watanabe, a former Minister of International
Trade and Industry.
    The next prime minister will have to grapple with an
indirect tax, and "whoever is the next prime minister won't be
in the job very long," Watanabe said.
    Watanabe said he doubted the next prime minister would be
any of the three so-called "New Leaders," LDP secretary general
Noboru Takeshita, LDP executive council chairman Shintaro Abe,
and Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. Each of them controls a
powerful LDP faction. "It will be somebody else," he said.
    Political science professor Rei Shiratori of Dokkyo
University gave one of the darkest readings on Nakasone's
political future.
    "Soon after the Venice summit, there will be a move to
change the government by the New Leaders," Shiratori said.
    "He can't fight on," he said.
    He said Nakasone had a special emotional attachment to the
sales tax plan as the last and most important item in Japan's
purge of policies inherited from the U.S. Occupation.
    Shiratori said an indirect tax will have to be levied, but
"to introduce such a tax, they'll have to change the prime
minister."
    Nevertheless, Shiratori said he believes Nakasone could
hang on until as late as September.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>U.K. ECONOMY STRONGER THAN AT BUDGET, LAWSON SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>0    LONDON, April 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.K. Economy looks stronger than it
did only last month, when the government unveiled its budget
for fiscal 1987/88, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson
said.
    He told Parliament that "all the indicators that have been
published since the budget confirm that, if anything, we are
doing even better than I suggested then." The budget was
unveiled on March 17.
    "The PSBR (Public Sector Borrowing Requirement) has come out
lower than I forecast in the Budget. Inflation, too, is lower
than I suggested ... (and) the current account of the balance
of payments is also performing better, so far, than I
predicted."
    The budget foresaw inflation easing to 4.0 pct at the end
of this year after peaking at around 4.5 pct. Lawson said at
the time that the overall 1986/87 PSBR would be around 4.0
billion stg. It was in fact lower, at 3.3 billion stg.
    He had also projected average GDP growth in calendar 1987
of 3.0 pct after 2.5 pct in 1986. Lawson today said "output
appears to be rising, if anything, rather faster."
    Speaking during a House of Commons debate, he said, "by the
end of this year we will have registered the longest period of
steady growth, at close to 3.0 pct a year, that the British
economy has known since the (Second World) War."
    The 1987/88 budget contained a proposal to cut the basic
rate of taxation by two pence, to 27 pence in the pound.
    Lawson today reaffirmed that the government aimed to
further cut the standard rate to "no more than 25p." He said that
that objective "should not take too long to achieve."
    Turning to policies proposed by political opposition
parties, Lawson said those advocated by the Labour Party would
entail extra public expenditure of some 34 billion stg.
    That, he said, "would require either a doubling of the basic
rates of income tax or more than trebling the standard rate of
(valued added tax) VAT," which is currently 15 pct.
    On value added tax, Lawson noted that the Conservative
government promised back in 1984 not to extend VAT to food.
    "Beyond that, the incidence of taxation has to be determined
in the light of the budgetary needs at the time, and no
responsible government could conceivably take any other
position," he said. Labour MPs have accused the Conservatives of
planning VAT increases for some essential consumer goods.
    Lawson reiterated his belief that reductions in taxation
can often produce higher, not lower, revenues  "thus leading to
the scope for still further reductions in taxation."
    Lawson said "inheritance tax is expected this year to yield
almost 50 pct more in real terms than Capital Transfer Tax did
in 1978-79. The yield of Capital Gains Tax is forecast to be 80
pct higher in real terms, and Stamp Duty up by 140 pct."
    He said that "the greatly increased yield of Corporation
Tax, reflecting greatly increased company profitability, is
clearly connected with the reform of Corporation Taxation I
introduced in 1984, which brought the rate of tax on company
profits in this country to the lowest in the industrialised
world."

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT -FRANCE AWAITS ECONOMIC LIFT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Brian Childs, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>A year after squeezing to power with a
narrow bare coalition majority, Gaullist Prime minister Jacques
Chirac has swept away a cobweb of controls and regulations
choking the French economy.
    But France is still waiting for a promised industrial
recovery the government says will follow from its free market
policies. Company profits and the stock market are rising. But
so is unemployment. Growth is stagnant at about two pct a year
and the outlook for inflation, held to a 20-year low of 2.1 pct
in 1986, is uncertain.
    Forced last month to cut the government's 1987 growth
target and raise its inflation estimate, Finance Minister
Edouard Balladur ruled out action to stimulate the economy. But
some government supporters say they fear time for an economic
miracle may be running out.
    The political clock is ticking towards Presidential
elections due by April next year.
    France's economic performance, led by a mixed cast of
right-wing ministers and a socialist President, has won mixed
reviews from non-partisan analysts.
    For Michel Develle, Director of Economic Studies at
newly-privatised Banque Paribas, the government's outstanding
achievement has been to launch "a veritable intellectual
revolution" breaking the staid habits formed by centuries of
state control.
    "The figures may look mediocre -- neither good nor bad --
but set in their context of structural reforms, they are
excellent," Develle said.
    But some analysts say they fear that Balladur, chief
architect of the government's free market policies, may be
pursuing a mirage.
    "The belief that economic liberalism will produce an
explosion of economic forces is ideological" said Indosuez chief
economist Jean Cheval. "Personally I think it's an illusion.
Dirigisme (direction) is a basic fact of the French system,
from school onwards. Ultra-liberalism is impossible."
    Illusion or not, the government has pushed its vision hard.
Over the past year foreign exchange and consumer price controls
have been largely abolished, labour regulations have been
pruned to ease the sacking of redundant workers and a hugely
popular programme has been launched to sell state-owned banks
and industries to private investors.
    Since December, nearly five mln French investors have
bought shares in Cie Financiere de Paribas &lt;PARI.PA> and glass
maker Cie de Saint-Gobain SA &lt;SGEP.PA>, the first two state
companies brought to the stock market under the 300 billion
franc five-year privatisation plan.
    Encouraged by an amnesty for past illegal exports of
capital, and the lifting of most currency controls, money has
flooded into the Paris stockmarket from abroad, helping to lift
the market 57 pct last year and another 12.5 pct since
December.
    At the end of last year the government abolished price
controls that had existed for 42 years on services such as car
repairs and hairdressing, freeing from state intervention small
businesses which account for some 60 pct of the French economy.
    The immediate result was a 0.9 pct rise in consumer prices
in January, partly responsible for a forced revision in the
official 1987 inflation forecast, to 2.5 pct from two pct or
less.
    "But even 2.5 pct would be a fantastic result, when you
consider that prices are now free for the first time since
1945," commented Develle of Paribas.
    Other achievements include a major reduction in the state's
foreign debts, and a cut in the state budget deficit to 141.1
billion francs last year, 2.5 billion francs below target and
down from 153.3 billion in 1985.
    But despite a healthy balance of payments surplus and a
gradual improvement in industrial productivity, the French
franc was forced by speculators in January into a humiliating
three pct devaluation against the West German mark, its second
since Chirac took power.
    A recent report by the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development pilloried French industry for
failing to produce the goods that its potential customers
wanted.
    Outside the mainly state-controlled high technology
sectors, French industrial goods were "increasingly ill-adapted
to demand" and over-priced, the report said.
    French economists, including Cheval at Indosuez, agreed
with the report. "One of the assumptions of the government is
that if you give them freedom, the employers will invest and
modernise....But nine out of ten will say yes, they like
freedom, and then wait to be told which way to go," he said.
    And despite rising industrial investment and the
introduction of special incentives to boost youth employment,
the end-1986 number of jobless was reported at a record 2.7
million, some 300,000 more than a year earlier.
    The problem for the government is that there may be little
more it can do to prod the economy into faster growth.
    French producers failed more than most to take advantage of
last year's oil price falls and growth hopes now rest on the
shaky prospects of expansion in other industrial countries like
West Germany and Japan, they say.

<TITLE>EC COMMISSION DEFENDS FARM PROGRAM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community's (EC)
executive Commission defended attacks on major elements of its
ambitious program to rid the EC of its controversial farm
surpluses, after strong attacks from northern states.
    Britain and West Germany, backed by the Netherlands and
Denmark, opposed a proposed tax on edible oils and fats which
has already sparked strong protest from exporters to the EC led
by the U.S. and from EC consumer groups, diplomats said.
    But EC Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen told
journalists he had warned ministers that failure to agree the
tax, proposed last month as part of the Commission's annual
farm price package, would leave a large hole in the group's
budget.
    He added that he hoped states had not yet made their mind
up for good. "I hope the debate is still open, if not there will
be a formidable hole in the budget," he said.
    The shortfall could reach two billion dollars in 1988 and
would be only slightly less this year, he said.
    Foreign ministers were taking a first look at the tax ahead
of farm ministers in a move described by diplomats as
unprecedented and welcomed by Andriessen as a sign ministers
recognised the importance of reforming the EC's farm policy.
    The proposed tax is designed to provide the EC with extra
cash to finance community oilseed crops at their current levels
and to brake a dramatic decrease in olive oil consumption by
making it more competitive with other oils.
    Andriessen noted the EC has over two mln olive oil
producers, mostly small farmers, who could be helped by the
tax.
    "What we are suggesting is reasonable, it should be better
understood not just outside the community but at home," he said.
    Britain, normally a keen advocate of radical changes in the
EC's costly farm subsidies system, warned the proposal to
impose the tax on both domestic and imported oils and fats
could seriously damage the EC's trade relations with other
countries.
    Britain also warned that the tax could hit developing
countries already receiving aid from the EC, they said.
    The Commission also defended proposals to dismantle
Monetary Compensatory Amounts (MCA) -- a system of cross border
subsidies and taxes to level out foreign exchange fluctuations
for farm exports -- against harsh West German criticism.
    In a letter this weekend from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to EC
executive Commission President, Jacques Delors, Kohl made clear
such a dismantling would mainly hit West German farmers.
    Diplomats said West Germany again repeated its criticism at
the talks here but Andriessen told journalists that Germany had
been alone in its opposition. The question was a key aspect of
the Commission's farm price proposals, he added.
   Ministers also agreed a 3.5 billion dlrs scheme to rid the
EC of its butter mountain, despite Spanish and Portuguese
opposition.
    The scheme will pay for the disposal of one mln tonnes of
unwanted butter, by selling it at knock-down prices, turning it
into animal feed or exporting it at subsidised prices.
    National capitals are due to be reimbursed later out of
savings from another plan to curb milk production.
    Diplomats said Spain and Portugal have been angered by the
scheme, which they feel forces them to pay for massive
surpluses built up before they joined the community last year,
but the two countries did not block today's vote.

<TITLE>TAIWAN BANKERS PREDICT MAJOR FINANCIAL REFORM</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Andrew Browne, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Taiwan is planning to significantly
relax foreign exchange controls within the next few months, but
there is little prospect of a sudden outflow of capital,
bankers and economists polled by Reuters said.
    They said a statement by Premier Yu Kuo-Hua last Friday
that Taiwan might suspend the controls indicated the government
was ready to allow Taiwanese firms and individuals to hold and
invest foreign currency for the first time.
    "There has been a major shift in government policy," said
Liang Kuo-Shu, chairman of the Chang Hwa Commercial Bank.
    Yu said foreign exchange controls, under which all foreign
currency must be converted into Taiwan dollars, might be
suspended if Taiwan's trade surplus grows too large. He said
controls could be retained for use in an emergency.
    Yu said the aim was to reduce Taiwan's foreign exchange
reserves and ease pressure on the money supply.
    The reserves have grown to a record 53 billion U.S. Dlrs,
compared with about 26 billion in late March last year, due to
Taiwan's widening trade surplus. The surplus hit a record 15.6
billion dlrs last year against 10.6 billion in 1985.
    Approximately 95 pct of the surplus was with the U.S.
    The surplus in the first two months of this year rose to
2.73 billion dlrs from 2.02 billion in the same 1986 period.
    Money supply grew by a seasonally adjusted 48.22 pct in the
year to end-february.
    Bankers and economists said they did not believe the
government intended to drop all foreign exchange controls and
allow the Taiwan dollar to be freely traded.
    But they said over the next few months certain restrictions
will probably be eased to allow Taiwanese firms and individuals
to hold part of their foreign exchange earnings for overseas
investment.
    Bankers and economists also said it was likely the
government would lift a ban on investment in foreign stocks.
They said it was uncertain, however, whether investment would
be direct or channeled through government-approved funds.
    Taiwan allowed firms and individuals to invest in overseas
government bonds, treasury bills and certificates of deposit
for the first time last year.
    Bankers said Yu's statment was an indication the government
is becoming increasingly concerned about the threat of
inflation posed by the growing foreign exchange reserves.
    Inflation is now running at about three pct.
    Mounting reserves are also seen as giving Washington
leverage in its efforts to force Taiwan to boost the value of
its currency to reduce the trade imbalance.
    Bankers said dropping foreign exchange restrictions was
unlikely to lead to significant capital outflows because of the
rising value of the Taiwan dollar.
    "All the signs are that capital would move in," said John
Brinsden, manager of Standard Chartered Bank in Taipei.
    The Taiwan dollar has risen by about 16 pct against the
U.S. Dollar since September 1985. It opened today at 34.26
against the American currency.
    Most economists believe the Taiwan dollar will continue to
rise this year on strong U.S. Pressure for appreciation.
    Economists estimate up to five billion U.S. Dlrs of
speculative money flowed into Taiwan last year.
    Yu's statement surprised most local and foreign bankers,
who regard the former central bank governor as a fiscal
arch-conservative. They said it shows Taiwan is determined to
go ahead with wide-ranging financial liberalisation.
    "It's more than a straw in the wind," said Brinsden. "It
indicates that something dramatic will happen."

<TITLE>U.S. SAFETY NETS SHOULD BLOCK 1929-TYPE CRASH</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Michael Posner</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cascading global stock prices are
evoking grim memories of the great market crash of 1929, but
analysts are reminding investors of safeguards in place before
they stash their savings under the mattress.
    But some also say that while banking, securities and social
laws written during the great depression should prevent a
repeat of that dismal era, more protection still might have to
be considered.
   
    And analysts caution that while new laws can deal with some
problems, lawmakers can't legislate away fear--which  helped
drive the New York Stock Exchange to its record 508-point Dow
Jones index loss on Monday.
    That 22.6 percent loss nearly doubled the Oct 29, 1929 
loss of 11.7 percent. On the day before that year, the market
fell nearly 13 per cent.
    In a series of Reuters interviews with government,
congressional and private analysts, most agreed safeguards
exist to avoid a repeat of 1929 and its depression aftermath.
    Charles Schultze, chairman of the president's Council of
Economic Advisers under Jimmy Carter, said in an interview that
"the safeguards should be adequate to avoid a repeat of 1929 to
1933."
    "The safeguards are fine," he said, "The safeguards are
adequate to prevent a cascading liquidity failure. That's not
the overall problem which is the dollar and trade deficits."
    Schultze, now with the Brookings Institution think-tank,
pointed to a weak Federal Reserve during the 1920s when "the Fed
acted in the wrong way in 1929--it tightened money."
   
    Similarly, President Reagan's budget manager, James Miller,
told Reuters the safeguards in place should be adequate.
    And millionaire oilman and business takeover specialist T.
Boone Pickens said the present safeguards should avoid any 1929
situation.
    "It is a much more sophisticated system, I don't see that a
comparison is valid."
    Marvin Kosters, director of economic policy studies at the
conservative American Enterprise Institute, thinks the present
safeguards will work.
   
    "The main thing is the understanding of the Federal Reserve
of its responsibility to maintain liquidity in the economy," he
said. "There is no reason why this (market fall) needs to spread
into the real economy. Maybe it's better it happened at all."
    Rex Hardesty of the huge labor confederation AFL-CIO said
many of the present safeguards are not working, saying "only
one-third of the unemployed are now receiving benefits."
    He also called for an increase in the 3.35 dlr minimum wage
which has not been raised since 1981.
    One of the main things that appears different in 1987 than
in 1929 is market psychology, analysts point out.
    During those anything goes days of flappers and bathtub
gin, the stock market was the road to riches that captured the
savings of shoeshine boys to bank presidents. It was viewed as
a highway to heaven with no turning back.
    But happy days soon collapsed into a nationwide, hysterical
panic with the stock market crash, wiping out paper millions
and losing the life savings of many average investors as panic
set in.
    Brokers leaped from Wall Street skyscrapers. American banks
closed for a  "holiday" in 1933 as depositors clamored to pull
out their savings. The great depression followed leading into
World War II.
    Images of those days surfaced with the unprecedented sell
off on Monday, but analysts maintained times are different.
    House Banking committee specialist Jake Lewis said that
bank investors should have no fears because their savings are
now completely backed by the government. 
    Even though there have been record bank failures --145 last
year, 148 this year through today--everyone received their
savings--unlike the millions lost when banks collapsed 60 years
ago.
     Banking deposits, then uninsured, now are fully insured by
the government up to 100,000 dlrs for each saver.
    As the depression swept the nation, President Franklin
Roosevelt steered into law sweeping banking and securities
reforms to deal with many of the problems that led to the crash
and hurt people afterwards.

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - AUSTERITY MEASURES IN HUNGARY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By David Lewis, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BUDAPEST, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hungary is to embark on a new series of
austerity measures to tackle a budget deficit which tripled
last year after quadrupling in 1985.
    The target deficit in the 1987 budget approved by
Parliament last December was 43.8 billion forints.
    But Zoltan Boesze, chief of the Finance Ministry's budget
financing division, told Reuters the government now saw this as
too high and had decided "quite severe" measures were needed.
    "All the organizations of economic management have been
charged with elaborating further (savings) measures," he said.
    Asked if these measures were being taken under pressure
from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Boesze said: "The
Fund suggested it would be good to improve monetary results,
and of course the Fund would support these efforts."
    IMF teams spent several weeks in Budapest late last year.
    Boesze said preliminary figures showed that Hungary's state
budget deficit rose to a preliminary 47 billion forints last
year from 15.8 billion in 1985 and 3.7 billion in 1984.
    The economy overshot a target deficit of 23 billion forints
because of poor performance by state firms, which needed
subsidies and tax incentives to export and earn hard currency.
    The exact extent and nature of savings are still under
discussion but subsidies to state enterprises -- the largest
budget item -- must definitely fall, Boesze said.
    Subsidies to state firms, including grants to maintain low
consumer prices, exceeded the plan by nine billion to reach 164
billion forints in 1986, up from 152.9 billion in 1985.
Parliament approved 1987 subsidies of 170 billion forints.
    "I think that in 1987 it is quite impossible to keep up the
former situation and we will be obliged to reduce subsidies,"
Boesze said. "The central administration must be hard. ... If we
are not hard then we will not be successful."
    Boesze said the budget could also make savings from reserve
provisions of two billion forints for central expenditure and
800 mln forints for transfers to local authorities. "I believe
these reserves should not be used at all," he said.
    Wage growth last year outstripped that of gross domestic
product, which expanded one pct instead of a planned 2.5 pct.
    The authorities had already signalled a small fall in real
wages for 1987, but Boesze said firms will suffer severe tax
penalties if they award nominal rises of over one or two pct.
    This would mean a severe cut in living standards, as retail
price inflation is forecast at seven pct after 5.3 pct in 1986.
    A four-month basic wage freeze expires on April 1.
    About 40 pct of the 1986 subsidies to state enterprises and
33 pct in 1985 were made to maintain low consumer prices.
    Boesze said pure economic policy would dictate significant
cuts in price subsidies, but that social considerations made
this difficult.
    But he added: "I think ultimately we will be able to make
curtailments in subsidies in this area as well."
    He said Hungary plans to introduce price reform at the
beginning of 1988 at the same time as personal taxation and
value added tax. The IMF supports these aims.
    Hungary introduced a bankrupcty law last September in an
attempt to shake out surplus labour from inefficient firms.
    Between 100,000 and 150,000 workers are expected to be
unemployed at least temporarily by 1990. Labour discipline is
being tightened and firms may fire workers more easily.
    Boesze said the per capita employment tax paid to the state
by firms was being raised this year to encourage enterprises to
shed labour. He gave no exact figures.
    Istvan Nagy, a senior Finance Ministry official responsible
for drafting the bankrupcy law, told Reuters last year he hoped
the law would cut state subsidies to enterprises by 50 pct.
    After subsidies to state enterprises, the largest single
budget items are social insurance (153 billion forints approved
for 1987) and transfers to local councils (80 billion).
    Interest payments on international debt are set to rise to
more than 10 billion forints in 1987 from between six and seven
billion in 1986, Boesze said.
    Hungary's net hard currency debt leapt by 54 pct last year
to 7.7 billion dlrs, according to provisional figures, while
trade with Western countries plunged into a deficit of more
than 400 mln dlrs from a 1.2 billion dlr surplus just two years
earlier.
    Boesze said last year's budget deficit was financed 90 pct
by credits from the National Bank, mostly from abroad, and 10
pct by the issue of domestic state bonds.
    Deputy Prime Minister Frigyes Berecz told Hungarian
economists in a speech this month that the country's economy
was in a "very difficult" situation, but not in crisis.
    There would have to be a turnround with tangible results
this year, however, and borrowing must be used more
effectively.
    "Any rise in our present loans may prove to be dangerous,"
Berecz said.
