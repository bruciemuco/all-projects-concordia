<TITLE>SAUDI CROWN PRINCE MEETS WITH US VICE PRES BUSH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah
bin Abdul Aziz met for an hour with Vice President George Bush
on Monday after U.S. naval forces destroyed one Iranian oil
platform in the Gulf and raided another.
    Asked at the start of the meeting how he felt about the
attack, the Crown Prince, who is here on an official visit,
replied, "I believe what the United States has done is their
responsibility as a superpower."
    His remark appeared to be an implicit endorsement of the
U.S. action, which the Pentagon said came in retaliation for
last Friday's Iranian missile attack on a U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti
tanker.
    Administration officials said Bush had assured the Crown
Prince the United States would "stay the course" in the Gulf.
    They said Prince Abdullah, who is deputy prime minister of
Saudi Arabia and commander of the kingdom's national guard, was
"very supportive" of the U.S. role in the strategic waterway.
    Before meeting with Bush, the Crown Prince paid a brief
courtesy call on President Reagan.
    During his stay in Washington, he was also scheduled to
meet with Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead, Defense
Secretary Caspar Weinberger and leaders of the House and Senate
foreign policy committees.

Alexander Haig has announced his intention to run for
president.
    Haig, a former general and NATO chief who served seven
presidents but never held elected office, said he will formally
announce his bid to run for the Republican presidential
nomination at a news conference later today.
    Haig's aides say he starts far back in the field of

<TITLE>CLARK SAYS HE EXPECTS U.S. ACTION ON ACID RAIN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canadian Foreign Secretary Joe
Clark, winding up a two-day visit to Washington, said he
expected the Reagan administration to take some action on
reducing acid rain.
    "My impression is there will be some movement by the United
States administration on acid rain (but) how much movement I
can't judge or predict," he told reporters.
    The meetings with American officials are part of a routine
U.S.-Canada consultation but are also expected to lay the
groundwork for a summit in Ottawa next month between President
Reagan and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
    Clark today held discussions with Treasury Secretary James
Baker and Democratic Sens. Patrick Moynihan of New York,
Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and
George Mitchell of Maine.
    Yesterday, he held talks with Vice President George Bush,
Secretary of State George Shultz and Commerce Secretary Malcolm
Baldrige.
    Among its priorities, Canada is seeking evidence that
Reagan is prepared to live up to a commitment made last year to
implement in the United States a five-year 5 billion U.S. dlr
program to test cleaner ways of burning coal.
    This issue was discussed at length with Baker and several
of the senators, including Mitchell who urged Canada to "keep
the heat on" the Reagan administration to force action, Canadian
officials said.
    Also taken up with most of the senators and Baker were
trade issues, including the need for the United States and
Canada to establish a better mechanism for settling trade
disputes between the two countries, who are each other's major
trading partner, Canadian officials said.

<TITLE>ABE SAYS 5,000 BILLION YEN PACKAGE TO SATISFY U.S.</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan's plan to stimulate its economy
will inject about 5,000 billion yen into the economy and should
be appreciated by the U.S., Ruling Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP) executive council chairman Shintaro Abe told reporters.
    "I expect considerable U.S. Appreciation of measures I have
personally prepared with cooperation of the government and the
LDP to help solve some individual issues pending with the
United States," he said.
    Abe, former Foreign Minister, starts a week long visit to
Washington on Sunday.
    Abe said he will meet President Reagan, Vice President
George Bush, Secretary of State George Shultz, Defence
Secretary Caspar Weinberger, Treasury Secretary James Baker,
White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker and as many Congressmen
as possible.
    Washington is likely to announce today a series of tariff
sanctions against Japanese electrical products after it accused
Tokyo of failing to meet terms of a 1986 bilateral pact on
computer chip trade.
    "I will ask U.S. Leaders to rescind any sanctions," said Abe.
    Japanese officials have said Tokyo would appeal to the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) for possible
compensation or the right to retaliate should U.S. Sanctions
materialise.
    But Abe said, "We should not repeat retaliatory measures.
What I would like to say to the United States is retaliation or
protectionism alone cannot solve our trade disputes."

<TITLE>SAUDI ROLE IN GULF PRAISED BY U.S. OFFICIALS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Abdullah
bin Abdul Aziz was thanked by the Reagan administration for his
country's close, and closed-mouthed, cooperation with
Washington in the Gulf, a senior U.S. official said.
    "The Saudis are being very cooperative. It would be nice if
the Saudis would go more public, but it's their real estate,"
said the official who asked not to be named.
    He declined to describe what sort of help the Saudis were
providing, saying that Saudi officials are reluctant to
acknowledge their role in the Gulf where the United States has
stationed forces to protect shipping lanes.
    The prince met Vice President George Bush on Monday after
U.S. naval forces attacked offshore Iranian oil platforms in
what Washington said was retaliation for an Iranian attack on a
ship moored off Kuwait and flying the U.S. flag.
    Asked at the start of the meeting how he felt about the
attack, the prince, who is here on an official visit, replied,
"I believe what the United States has done is their
responsibility as a superpower."
    The senior U.S. official said his remark was an endorsement
of the U.S. attack.

<TITLE>CLARK HOLDS TALKS WITH SHULTZ IN WASHINGTON</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>Foreign Secretary Joe Clark urged
the United States to take firm action on reducing "acid rain" and
on sticking with the strict interpretation of the
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty but said he won no promises.
    After a day of meetings with Vice President George Bush,
Secretary of State George Shultz and Commerce Secretary Malcolm
Baldrige, Clark told a press conference he was persuaded the
Reagan adminstration had begun to deal seriously with Canada
and its concerns.
    But he admitted he had won no assurances Washington would
go along with his government's position on several key
controversial issues.
    "There's a lot more attention to Canadian files. What
remains to be seen is how much progress will be achieved," he
told reporters.
    The meetings, which end today with talks on Capitol Hill,
are part of a routine U.S.-Canadian consultation but are also
expected to lay groundwork for a summit in Ottawa next month
between President Reagan and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
    Clark discouraged speculation that lack of a firm American
committment on the thorny issue of acid rain could render the
summit a failure.
    Canada is seeking evidence that Reagan is prepared to live
up to a commitment made last year to implement in the United
States a five-year five billion dlr U.S. program to test
cleaner ways of burning coal.
    "We expect the U.S. government to honor its commitment" and
discussed this with Shultz today, Clark said.
    "There's no question the matter is under serious detailed
consideration at the highest levels of the U.S. government," he
said, adding that Shultz "left my meeting today to attend a
(White House) cabinet meeting that was discussing this as well
as other questions."
    "We will wait and see the results of that examination," he
said.
    Clark also said he reiterated Canada's position that the
United States should adhere to a strict interpretation of the
1972 ABM treaty, the only remaining operative arms control
agreement.

<TITLE>REAGAN DENIES TOLD IRAN PROFITS WENT TO CONTRAS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan denied he had been
told that profits from sales of arms to Iran had been used to
aid the U.S.-backed "contra" rebels in Nicaragua.
    "No, that is not true," he said before a televised news
conference when asked about reports that he had been told about
the money diversion by his former National Security Adviser,
John Poindexter.
    Reagan was giving his first formal White House press
conference in four months since the Iran arms affair burst into
scandal with the disclosure profits from weapons sales had been
diverted, possibly illegally, to the contras.
    He said the secret approach to Iran had resulted in the
release of three American hostages held by pro-Iranian elements
in Lebanon and that it might have freed more if the operation
had not been made public.
    Reagan told reporters -- as he had told a presidential
commission that investigated the scandal -- that he did not
remember when he had approved an August, 1985, shipment of U.S.
arms to Iran through Israel.
    Reagan opened the news conference -- seen as vital in
rebuilding his damaged presidency and restoring his authority
-- with a statement on the yawning U.S. budget deficit.
    He again stated his opposition to tax increases and called
for a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.
    Asked if in hindsight he would again start a secret program
to sell arms to Iran, Reagan said, "No, I would not go down that
same road again."
    Tonight's news conference was widely seen as an opportunity
for Reagan, 76, to demonstrate he was in command of affairs
despite the crisis.
    Reagan said, referring to the Iran arms program, "If I
hadn't thought it was right in the beginning, I never would
have started it."
    He said he went into the deal because he was persuaded that
he was not dealing directly with the kidnappers.
    "You cannot do business with them," he said.
    But "suddenly you have a third party there (Iran) ... and it
was not trading with the kidnappers," he said.
    The news conference in the White House East Room lasted 32
minutes -- two minutes more than normal -- most of which was
devoted to the Iran affair.
    At the last minute, a reporter asked whether Vice President
George Bush had opposed the arms sales as Secretary of State
George Shultz and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger had done.
    Reagan replied, "No," smiled, waved and walked away from the
podium toward the White House residence.

<TITLE>STOCK MARKET'S FALL MAY BE BAD OMEN FOR REPUBLICANS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By MICHAEL GELB</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Monday's stock market collapse could
spell disaster for Republican hopes of retaining the White
House in 1988 -- if it proves to be the start of a general
economic downturn -- political experts said.
    "The question is does the stock market (decline) signal an
impending recession. If that is the case the Republicans will
have a very difficult time winning," independent political
analyst William Schneider told Reuters. "If the Democrats
nominate anyone halfway credible they would win," he added.
    Schneider's comments, on the heels of a 500-point decline
in the bellwheter Dow Jones stock market average, reflected the
old political adage that elections are almost always decided by
voters' feelings about their financial well being.
    "There is no doubt people always vote their pocketbook and
we don't expect 1988 to be any different," says Donald Foley,
the top spokesman for Missouri Representative Richard
Gephardt's Democratic presidential campaign.
    Foley added that the five-year old stock market rally has
shown amazing resilience and "there's no telling where the
market will be by the end of the week."
    President Reagan said he was puzzled by the day's events,
but is convinced the economy is fundamentally sound.
    "I think everyone is puzzled ... because all the business
indices are up. There is nothing wrong with the economy," he
told reporters.
    "I don't think anyone should panic because all the economic
indicators are solid," he added.
    But for the time being, the decline on Wall Street knocked
the underpinnings from his boasts that the record bull market
demonstrates the wisdom of current economic policy.
    It could also deprive the Republicans of a major argument
for keeping the White House in their hands when President
Reagan leaves office in January 1989.
    It gives a hollow ring to the words used by Vice President
George Bush just a week ago when he formally entered the White
House race.
    "We have weathered the storm. Our economy has recovered to
be the strongest in history," Bush said in reference to the
recovery from the 1981-82 recession that pushed unemployment to
its highest level since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
    "We mark next week the longest peacetime economic expansion
in our nation's recorded history," Bush bragged.
    At midday, even as Wall Street was being battered by a
record selling panic, Reagan gave a glowing account of the
economy's performance at a swearing in ceremony for his new
Commerce Secretary, William Verity.
    Indeed, the Labor Department reported earlier this month
that unemployment among American workers had fallen to an
eight-year low of 5.9 pct in September, compared to seven pct a
year ago and a Post World War Two peak of 10.7 pct in December
1982.
    But with interest rates climbing steadily and no
improvement in the record U.S. trade deficit with the rest of
the world, a number of economic experts have expressed doubts
about the staying power of the current expansion.
   Warnings of economic danger around the corner have been a
staple of Democratic campaign speeches this year.
    And Democratic party leaders here for an organizational
meeting two weeks ago predicted at that time that the economy
would be the determining factor in next year's election.
    "The 1988 election will be decided, as most peacetime
elections are, on economic issues," said Michigan party chairman
Richard Weiner.
    "In Ohio, people are uneasy. They want to know where the
economy is going," added Ohio Democratic leader James Ruvulo.
    American political history is replete with examples of
voters throwing out incumbent officeholders when the economy
turns sour -- most notably in 1932 when Democrat Franklin
Roosevelt won a landslide triumph that ended 12 years of
Republican rule and made the Democrats the nation's majority
party for more than 40 years.
    But political experts said that if Monday's stock decline
turns out to be a temporary phenomena it will have no effect on
the 1988 election.
    "Times change, conditions change," Schneider said.
    Quoting legendary baseball manager Casey Stengel, Schneider
added, "Never make predictions, especially about the future."

<TITLE>JUDGE, EX-SENATOR AMONG CONTENDERS FOR SEC POST</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 23 - </DATELINE><BODY>A federal judge and a former U.S.
senator are among the top contenders to replace John Shad as
chairman of the federal Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC), government sources said.
    Also on the list of possible replacements are two current
SEC commissioners, said the sources who asked not to be named.
    Last week the White House said it would name Shad U.S.
ambassador to the Netherlands. Among those most frequently
placed on the short list of Shad's possible successors were
Kevin Duffy, a New York federal judge, and Nicholas Brady, who
served about eight months in the Senate in 1981.
    Brady, currently a managing partner with the New York
investment banking firm of Dillon, Read and Co Inc, was an
interim replacement for Sen. Harrison Williams (D-N.J.) after
Williams resigned in a congressional bribery scandal. Duffy was
SEC New York regional administrator during 1969-72.
    However, congressional sources speculated Brady may be
unwilling to take the SEC post because he is active in Vice
President George Bush's presidential campaign.
    The SEC commissioners said to be possible replacements for
Shad are Charles Cox and Edward Fleischman.
    Fleischman was a New York securities lawyer before his SEC
appointment while Cox was the commission's chief economist.
    Sen. William Proxmire, the Wisconsin Democrat whose Senate
Banking Committee would hold confirmation hearings on the new
chairman, said he hoped that Shad's successor "would be very
supportive of the division of enforcement's on-going
investigation of the scandals on Wall Street and would be
someone who did not come directly from the industry."
    The White House said on Friday it would nominate Shad, 63,
to succeed L. Paul Bremer as the U.S. ambassador to the
Netherlands.

<TITLE>IRAN INVESTIGATORS SEEK REAGAN TAPES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The House and Senate committees
investigating the Iran arms scandal said they would like to
review tapes of phone conversations between President Reagan
and White House officials, if such tapes exist.
    The committees were responding to a magazine article
that quoted unidentified "sources with first-hand knowledge of
U.S. communications intelligence" as saying there is an archive
of recorded conversations among Reagan administration
officials, including the president.
    The article in Progressive magazine also said the
government had secretly monitored the home telephone of former
National Security adviser Robert McFarlane after he had left
government service in late 1985.
    "According to sources with first hand knowledge of U.S.
communications intelligence operations," the story said, "the
McFarlane intercept grew out of a program that has produced a
still-undisclosed archive of recorded conversations involving
... Reagan, Vice President George Bush, (fired National
Security Council aide) Lt Col Oliver North, (former National
Security Adviser) Adm John Poindexter, (former White House
Chief of Staff) Donald Regan and other key figures in the
Iran-contra arms scandal."
    It said the monitoring was done for security and record
purposes by the top-secret National Security Agency (NSA), and
was apparently done with the consent of those monitored.
    But White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater denied one
premise of the article, saying, "The National Security Agency
said it did not monitor any of McFarlane's conversations."
    He did not comment on the other recorded conversations the
Progressive article said were included in the program.
    "Clearly we would be interested in taking a look if indeed
such tapes exist," a Senate Iran committee aide told Reuters in
response to the magazine article.
    A spokesman for the House Iran committee said the panel
would consider a request to the NSA for copies of the
telephone-tap archive described in the article.
    Several legislators said the tapes, if it is confirmed that
they exist, could prove invaluable to the special House and
Senate committees that were created in January to investigate
Reagan's most damaging political crisis.
    "This sort of evidence could be absolutely crucial in
getting to the bottom of the affair," said Rep. Robert
Kastenmeier, a Wisconsin Democrat and member of the House
Intelligence Committee, told Reuters.

<TITLE>REGAN DEPARTURE MAKES 3RD VOLCKER TERM LIKELY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Torday, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Last week's White House shake-up has
increased the odds that Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul
Volcker, a symbol of strength in a government reeling from the
arms-to-Iran scandal, will serve a third term, sources close to
the Fed say.
    But they said that no decision on the appointment, which
must be filled this August, has been taken by the White House
and Volcker too has not made up his mind.
    Former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan, who
resigned last week when ex-senator Howard Baker was named as
his replacement, was implacably opposed to Volcker and tried
often to undermine him.
    It is an open secret in Washington that Regan tried to
ensure that Volcker, first appointed in 1979 by President
Carter, will not be offered a third term by President Reagan.
    Only Volcker's key allies in the Reagan administration,
Vice-President George Bush and Treasury Secretary James Baker,
kept Regan's recent maneuvering at bay, the sources said.
    Sources close to the administration say Regan leaked a
story, quickly shot down by others in the administration, that
Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the council of economic advisers,
had been chosen to replace Volcker.
    But as the administration's credibility was increasingly
under fire, it became clear that Regan's power to bring about
such changes was on the wane.
    The sources said New White House Chief of Staff Howard
Baker has a very good relationship with his namesake at the
Treasury Department and is likely to respect his views on the
Fed chairmanship.
    As a moderate Republican, Baker is also unlikely to share
the right-wing's opposition to Volcker.
    "This new White House is going to need all the strength it
can get," said one source when asked about the possibility of
Volcker's reappointment.
    Paul Volcker is deeply respected in financial markets both
in the United States and around the world. At a time when the
stability of the dollar and the viability of major debtor
nations are in question, Volcker's departure would definitely
undermine U.S. leadership, foreign exchange analysts say.
    U.S. officials say Volcker works very closely with Treasury
Secretary Baker on issues like international debt and global
economic cooperation.
    The two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulate
the banking industry, but recent statements by Volcker, in
which he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation,
signalled the politically-independent central bank is coming
around at least partially to the Treasury position.
    And a recent statement by a Reagan administration official
that the two men saw "exactly eye-to-eye" on the dollar was seen
as an indication of Baker's support for the Fed chairman.
    Baker is understood to have played a key role in Volcker's
reappointment to the Fed in mid-1983.
    The sources said Baker respects Volcker and when appointed
Treasury Secretary in February 1985, he decided to ensure a
good working relationship, in part because he believed the two
key government economic institutions have to work closely.
    Regan, Treasury Secretary during President Reagan's first
term, was formerly head of Wall Street's largest brokerage firm
Merrill Lynch and came to Washington determined to be America's
pre-eminent economic spokesman.
    He developed a deep antipathy for Volcker, whose political
skills undermined that ambition, and who financial markets took
much more seriously.
    But the sources said Volcker would have to be invited to
stay. "Is the president going to ask him? he wouldn't stay
otherwise," said one. "He'd have to be asked," said Stephen
Axilrod, formerly staff director of monetary policy at the Fed
and now vice-chairman of Nikko Securities Co. International.
    Otherwise, the list of potential candidates is not
awe-inspiring. And if Volcker left this Augsut, he would leave
behind one of the most inexperienced Fed Boards in years.
    Many analysts believe this lack of collective experience --
the four sitting members were all appointed within the last
three years -- is dangerous, coming at a time when the global
economy is threatened by instability.
    An experienced successor, therefore, would seem a
necessity. One widely mentioned possibility is Secretary of
State George Shultz, whose experience as Treasury Secretary
under Preesident Nixon and background as a trained economist
would make him ideal.
    But Shultz too may have been damaged by the arms-to-Iran
scandal, while vice-chairman Manuel Johnson is regarded at 37
years old as too young for the job.
    Other potential candidates include economist Alan
Greenspan, frequently an informal presidential economic
adviser, New York Fed President E. Gerald Corrigan, Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp chairman William Seidman, and Sprinkel.
    Long a Regan protege, Sprinkel's chances may be damaged by
his patron's departure from the White House.

<TITLE>IRAN PROBERS AGREE ON IMMUNITY FOR POINDEXTER</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Michael Posner</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Congressional investigators of the
Iran-contra scandal have tentatively agreed to grant immunity
from prosecution to a star witness --President Reagan's former
national security adviser John Poindexter, congressional
sources said today.
    Sources told Reuters the chief counsels of the two special
committees probing the two-year episode that has darkened the
White House image plan to take their preliminary accord to
court-appointed special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh, possibly
today or tomorrow.
    The tentative accord follows weeks of negotiating with
Walsh and with committee members.
   Poindexter would be the highest ranking official to be
granted immunity in the investigations of the 1985-1986 arms
sales to Iran to gain release of hostages held in Lebanon and
the clandestine shifting of arms profits to arm U.S.-backed
rebels in Nicaragua, at a time aid would have been illegal.
    If the agreement --reached on Friday by Arthur Liman and
John Nields, chief legal advisors of the Senate and House
committees respectively --is ratified as expected by Walsh and
the full committees, closed door interviews could be held with
Poindexter in two months with public testimony in about 90 days
or mid June, sources said.
    "They have tentatively reached an agreement and are supposed
to meet with Walsh or his deputies," a source told Reuters of
the deliberations by the two chief counsels
    Sources said Poindexter could assist investigators
determine what Reagan knew about the diversion of funds from
arms sales to Iran to rebels in Nicaragua, if anything.
    Reagan has denied knowing about the shift of funds although
he has admitted he gave orders to sell arms through Israel in
either August or after the first shipment in September 1985,
but can't remember when. Congress was kept in the dark about
the affair until last autumn.
    "He will be a credible witness," one source said of the
pipe-smoking Poindexter. 
    Besides Reagan's knowledge, or lack of it, another key
unanswered questions lingering from earlier congressional
investigators and a special presidential review board, is who
received  millions of dollars from clandestine arms profits.  
    So far the money trail uncovered by probers stops at secret
Swiss and Cayman Islands bank accounts.
    The committees have been privately negotiating with Walsh
over the immunity matter, and the prosecutor, also called an
independent counsel, has been urging the committees to hold off
on their request for at least 90 days.
    Under the tentative accord, the wishes of Walsh could be
met since public testimony is not expected before 90 days.
    Poindexter, a Navy vice admiral, along with his fired
deputy at the National Security Council, Marine Lt. Col. Oliver
North, have refused to testify before investigators,
claiming their fifth amendment rights against self
incrimination.
    Yesterday, Vice President George Bush said in a a
television interview that he disagreed with Maureen about court
martials, but he too disclaimed any details of diverted funds.
    So far, granting immunity to compel testimony from
reluctant witnesses has been granted to five persons--with the
key figure so far, shadowy California international arms
merchant Albert Hakim.
    Also, getting immunity has been North's attractive personal
secretary, Fawn Hall, who was said to have assisted North in
shredding documents in his White House basement office after
the scandal broke.

<TITLE>REGAN DEPARTURE MAKES 3RD VOLCKER TERM LIKELY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Torday, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Last week's White House shake-up has
increased the odds that Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul
Volcker, a symbol of strength in a government reeling from the
arms-to-Iran scandal, will serve a third term, sources close to
the Fed say.
    But they said that no decision on the appointment, which
must be filled this August, has been taken by the White House
and Volcker too has not made up his mind.
    Former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan, who
resigned last week when ex-senator Howard Baker was named as
his replacement, was implacably opposed to Volcker and tried
often to undermine him.
    It is an open secret in Washington that Regan tried to
ensure that Volcker, first appointed in 1979 by President
Carter, will not be offered a third term by President Reagan.
    Only Volcker's key allies in the Reagan administration,
Vice-President George Bush and Treasury Secretary James Baker,
kept Regan's recent maneuvering at bay, the sources said.
    Sources close to the administration say Regan leaked a
story, quickly shot down by others in the administration, that
Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the council of economic advisers,
had been chosen to replace Volcker.
    But as the administration's credibility was increasingly
