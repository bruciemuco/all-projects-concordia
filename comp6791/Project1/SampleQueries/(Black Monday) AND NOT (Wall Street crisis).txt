<TITLE>JAPANESE PREMIER SAYS HE WATCHING STOCK SITUATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone
was quoted by Kyodo News Service as saying he was watching the
stock market situation.
    "We must watch things a little longer. New York is down 22
pct, London 10 pct, while compared to this Japan is seven pct
down," Kyodo quoted him as telling reporters.
    Asked if he agreed with analysts who called the stock
sell-off "Black Monday," Nakasone said: "Compared with times past,
economics have changed completely." He rejected a comparison
between the present situation and the stock market collapse of
1929 and the recession which followed.

<TITLE>POLL SHOWS AMERICANS HOLD ON TO STOCKS AFTER DROP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The "Black Monday" stock market crash
failed to destroy Americans' faith in the economic soundness of
the country, according to a poll released on Tuesday.
    The ABC-Washington Post poll, taken after the close of
stock trading on Monday, showed 58 pct did not believe the
unprecedented slide in stock prices foretold an economic
downturn, and 70 pct rejected the notion the country faced a
1930s-style Depression.
    Fifty-three pct of those interviewed said they had owned
stocks at some point, and only one pct said they had sold any
as a result of Monday's decline.
    Of the 40 pct who currently held stocks, only two pct said
they planned to sell some and four pct said they planned to
buy.
    The poll of 507 men and women was taken by telephone on
Monday night, after the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged
more than 500 points, or 22 pct, in record volume.

<TITLE>YUGOSLAV ECONOMIC PLAN SEEN FACING HURDLES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Andrej Gustincic</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BELGRADE, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Yugoslavia's ambitious economic recovery
and anti-inflation plan faces major hurdles before it can be
implemented, Yugoslav economists and Western diplomats said.
    Prime Minister Branko Mikulic on Monday proposed new taxes
hitting high income earners, moonlighters, property and
interest on savings as part of new government plans to rein in
the country's 123 pct inflation.
    He also proposed price and wage restraint and the trimming
of repayments on the 20 billion dlr foreign debt in line with
currency earning abiltiy.
    "The taxes will anger many Yugoslavs struggling with
soaring prices and will be resisted in Parliament," a Western
diplomatic source said. Yugoslav economists said Mikulic's
draft plans left many questions unanswered.
    "It was a list of goals, not concrete measures," said a
senior Yugoslav economist at a leading Yugoslav research
institute.
    The state news agency Tanjug was more optimistic. It said
the proposals indicated "real economic reforms" were coming.
    Further details of the program, which Mikulic summarised in
Parliament, are to appear in the days ahead, and the draft has
to be debated and voted on by deputies in November.
    "The goals are good," a leading Belgrade economist said.
"No one can argue with that. But the million dollar question,
as with all government programs here, is how they will be
implemented."
    Zoran Popov, senior research fellow at The Belgrade
Institute for Industrial Economy said the existing system made
many of the proposals difficult to put into effect.
    "A change in the the system of taxation requires changes in
the constitution," he said. "Mikulic's speech tells us what he
wants to do, but not how."
    "It may be anti-inflationary," one diplomat said. "But the
question is how can you tax a black economy and how will the
government find out who has two jobs or more than one home."
    Economists and diplomats said the proposals could be
resisted by deputies from several of Yugoslavia's constituent
republics and provinces in defence of regional interests.
    Such resistance has blocked the nationwide implementation
of federal government economic policy on many past occasions.

<TITLE>S. AFRICA MINING HOUSE REPORTS HUGE STRIKE LOSSES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JOHANNESBURG, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>A major South African mining house
on Monday reported two of its gold mines suffered huge losses
as a result of a black miners' strike in August which crippled
about half the country's crucial gold mines.
    Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Company, one of the
six major mining houses, said the two mines suffered a combined
net loss of 9.7 mln dlrs in the three months to end-September
compared with a profit of 8.6 mln dlrs in the preceding
quarter.
    It was the first indication of the real economic impact of
the biggest wage strike in the history of the gold mining
industry, which accounts for nearly half the value of South
Africa's total exports.
    "The results were pretty disastrous, primarily due to the
impact of the strike," Ken Maxwell, head of Johannesburg
Consolidated's gold division, told a news conference in
Johannesburg.
    "We haven't recovered from the strike yet," he said, adding
that 70 percent of underground mining at the group's biggest
mine, Randfontein Estates, was halted by the three-week strike.
    Johannesburg Consolidated and its controlling company, the
giant Anglo American Corp., were hard-hit by the three-week
miners' strike, but refused to disclose production losses.
    Anglo American is due to report its quarterly gold-mine
profits later this week.
